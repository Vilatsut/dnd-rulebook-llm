# WELCOME TO DUNGEONS & DRAGONS

Driven by imagination, Dungeons & Dragons is a cooperative game in which the characters you roleplay embark on adventures together in fantasy worlds filled with monsters and magic. This set gives you and up to five of your friends everything you need—besides your imagination and a pencil—to journey in one of those worlds.

## WHAT'S IN THIS SET

This set includes the following components:

**Rulebook.** This rulebook contains all the rules you need to start playing D&D.

**Adventure Booklet.** The other booklet in this set contains an adventure for you to play. Only the person who's going to run the adventure should read that booklet.

**Character Sheets.** Five different characters—a cleric, a fighter, a paladin, a rogue, and a wizard—are provided for up to five players to choose from. The characters that your group choose will go on the adventure in the adventure booklet.

**Dice.** All the dice you need to play are included.

## GETTING STARTED

If this is your first time playing D&D, start by reading the rest of this introduction and chapter 1. They tell you the most important rules for play. Visit dnd.wizards.com/starter for additional guidance.

The next step is to decide who is going to run the adventure—that person is called the **Dungeon Master or DM**—and who's going to play the adventurers.

[QR CODE IMAGE]

## BEING A PLAYER

Each player chooses a character, an adventurer who teams up with the other players' adventurers. This set comes with several characters to choose from, each one printed on their own sheet. Take a look at each of the sheets, and choose the character who looks the most fun to play. Whichever characters you and the other players choose, the characters are assumed to be allies as they face the dangers of D&D together. The DM presents exciting challenges, your friends, and handsome rewards to your characters. The DM is not your foe but does present dangers that provide opportunities for your adventurers to shine and then thrive.

The adventure in this set works best for four or five characters, so if you have fewer than four players, we recommend some of you play more than one character.

## BEING THE DM

Instead of choosing a character, one participant takes on the role of the DM, the game's lead storyteller and referee. The DM runs the adventure for the characters, who navigate its hazards and decide which paths to explore. The DM describes the locations and creatures that the adventurers face, and the players decide what they want their characters to do. Then the DM, using imagination and the game's rules, determines the results of the adventurers' actions and narrates what they experience. Because the DM can improvise to react to anything the players attempt, D&D is infinitely flexible.

If you decide to be the DM, make sure to familiarize yourself with this rulebook, and read the adventure booklet. You'll then be ready to gather your friends together to play.

## RHYTHM OF PLAY

Once the DM is ready to run the adventure and the players have chosen their characters, the group gathers for a session of play. In a typical D&D session, play unfolds in **encounters**—similar to how a movie comprises scenes—and in each encounter, there are chances for the DM to describe creatures and places and for characters to make choices. Here's an example of the start of an encounter:

> **Dungeon Master (DM):** A crumbling castle stands among the trees, the ruins of seven towers jutting up from it like broken teeth. An archway littered with rusted metal gapes open at the top of a short flight of steps. Just inside that opening, you spot two skeletal guards with glowing red eyes.
>
> **Phillip (playing Nica, the cleric):** Let's send the rogue up ahead to look in and see if there are more than two guards.
>
> **Amy (playing Diana, the rogue):** OK, I'll sneak up until I can peer in through the entrance.
>
> **DM:** All right, let's see how sneaky you are. Make a Dexterity check.
>
> **Amy:** Using my Stealth proficiency, right?
>
> **DM:** You bet.
>
> **Amy (rolling a d20):** Diana's pretty sneaky—that's a 17.
>
> **DM:** There's no sign the skeletal guards spot you, and you don't notice any others.


# GAME DICE

The game uses dice with different numbers of sides. In these rules, the different dice are referred to by the letter *d* followed by the number of sides: **d4**, **d6**, **d8**, **d10** (with 0 standing for 10), **d12**, and **d20**. For instance, a d6 is a six-sided die.

When you need to roll dice, the rules tell you how many dice to roll of a certain type, as well as what modifiers (positive or negative) to add. For example, "3d8 + 5" means you roll an eight-sided die three times, add the rolls together, and add 5 to the total.

Percentile dice, or **d100**, work differently. You generate a number between 1 and 100 by rolling a ten-sided die twice. The first roll gives the tens digit, and the second roll gives the ones digit. For example, if you roll a 7 and a 1, the number rolled is 71, and if you roll a 0 and a 5, the number rolled is 5. Two 0s represent 100.

# TERMS TO REMEMBER

**adventure.** An adventure is a series of encounters that help tell a story and present the players' characters with important choices.

**character sheet.** A character sheet is a piece of paper or digital record that bears a character's game statistics.

**creature.** Any living being in the game, including a player's character, is a creature. Each creature belongs to a type: Aberration, Beast, Celestial, Construct, Dragon, Elemental, Fey, Fiend, Giant, Humanoid, Monstrosity, Ooze, Plant, or Undead. Some rules in the game affect creatures of certain types in different ways. For example, the text of the *cure wounds* spell specifies that the spell doesn't work on a creature that has the Undead type.

**dungeon.** A dungeon is any indoor adventure location, whether underground, in a castle, or in a city.

**encounter.** An encounter is a scene in an adventure, incorporating a fantasy location and often friends or foes.

**monster.** A creature controlled by the DM is a monster, even if the creature is benevolent. A monster with a personal name is sometimes called an NPC (nonplayer character), especially if it isn't combative.

**object.** An object is a nonliving, distinct thing. Composite things, like buildings, comprise more than one object.

**player character.** A player character—"character" for short—is an adventurer controlled by a player.

**stat block.** A stat block contains the game statistics of a monster. It's effectively the monster's character sheet.

## WHAT'S NEXT?

If you'd like to delve deeper into D&D, check out the fifth edition *Player's Handbook*, *Monster Manual*, and *Dungeon Master's Guide*. These advanced rulebooks introduce you to the vast multiverse of D&D and invite you to create characters and worlds within it.

----

In that example, three main steps are present, and those steps occur in every D&D encounter, whether it's a peaceful encounter or a fight:

**1: The DM describes the environment.** The DM tells the players where their adventurers are and what's around them, presenting the basic scope of options (how many doors lead out of a room, what's on a table, who's in the tavern, and so on).

**2: The players decide what their characters do.** A character's sheet contains various things that the character can do. When deciding what your character does, you may choose something on the sheet, or you may make something up. Whatever you decide, describe the intended action to the DM and the other players. Sometimes all the characters do the same thing, and other times, different adventurers do different things; one adventurer might search a treasure chest while a second examines a symbol engraved on a wall, for example. Outside combat, the characters don't need to take turns, but the DM listens to every player and decides how to resolve those actions. In combat, everyone takes turns in order, as explained in the "Combat" section (page 9). Either way, the DM tells you what happens next.

**3: The DM narrates the results of the action.** Sometimes, resolving a task is easy. If an adventurer wants to walk across a room and open a door, the DM might just say that the door opens and describe what lies beyond. But the door might be locked, the floor might hide a deadly trap, or some other circumstance might make it challenging for an adventurer to complete a task. In those cases, the DM checks to see if there are relevant rules—on a character sheet, in this rulebook, or in the adventure—and then decides what happens, often relying on the roll of a die to determine the results of an action. Describing the results often leads to another decision point, which brings the flow of the game right back to step 1.


# CHAPTER 1
# PLAYING THE GAME

THIS CHAPTER PRESENTS THE MAIN RULES OF PLAY. Many of the rules refer to six abilities (described below) possessed by every character and monster. You use these abilities in many different situations, including combat, social interaction, and exploration—the rules for which are presented in this chapter.

## SIX ABILITIES

Six abilities briefly describe a creature's physical and mental characteristics. These abilities appear on an adventurer's character sheet and in a monster's stat block:

**Strength**, measuring physical power
**Dexterity**, measuring agility, reflexes, and balance
**Constitution**, measuring endurance
**Intelligence**, measuring reasoning and memory
**Wisdom**, measuring perceptiveness and intuition
**Charisma**, measuring force of personality

Each ability has a score, ranging from 3 to 18 for most adventurers. The highest a character's score can reach is 20. Monsters can have scores as low as 1 or as high as 30.

An ability score's most important function is providing an **ability modifier**—a positive or negative number added to ability checks, saving throws, and attack rolls, as explained in the rest of this chapter. The Ability Scores and Modifiers table shows the modifier that each score provides.

## ABILITY SCORES AND MODIFIERS

| Score | Modifier | Score | Modifier |
| ----- | -------- | ----- | -------- |
| 1     | -5       | 16-17 | +3       |
| 2-3   | -4       | 18-19 | +4       |
| 4-5   | -3       | 20-21 | +5       |
| 6-7   | -2       | 22-23 | +6       |
| 8-9   | -1       | 24-25 | +7       |
| 10-11 | +0       | 26-27 | +8       |
| 12-13 | +1       | 28-29 | +9       |
| 14-15 | +2       | 30    | +10      |


## THE D20 ROLL

When the outcome of an action is uncertain, the game relies on a d20 roll to determine success or failure. **Ability checks**, **saving throws**, and **attack rolls** are the three main kinds of d20 rolls, and whenever you make one, the roll is associated with one of the six abilities. The roll follows these steps:

**1: Roll a d20, and add the relevant ability modifier.** The rest of this rulebook specifies which ability modifier to use for different types of d20 rolls.

**2: Add your proficiency bonus if relevant.** Each character has a proficiency bonus, a number you add when making a d20 roll that uses something in which your character has proficiency. See the "Proficiencies" section for more information.


**3: Apply circumstantial bonuses and penalties.** A class feature, a spell, or another rule might give a bonus or a penalty to the roll. Also, the roll might have advantage or disadvantage, explained in the "Advantage & Disadvantage" section.

**4: Compare the total to a target number.** If the total of the d20 roll and its modifiers equals or exceeds the target number, the ability check, attack roll, or saving throw is a success. Otherwise, it's a failure. The DM determines target numbers and tells players whether their rolls are successful. The target number for an ability check or a saving throw is called a **Difficulty Class** (DC). The most common DCs for ability checks are in the Typical Difficulty Classes table. The target number for an attack roll is called **Armor Class** (AC), which appears on a character sheet or in a stat block.

## TYPICAL DIFFICULTY CLASSES

| Task Difficulty | DC | Task Difficulty   | DC |
| --------------- | -- | ----------------- | -- |
| Very easy       | 5  | Hard              | 20 |
| Easy            | 10 | Very hard         | 25 |
| Medium          | 15 | Nearly impossible | 30 |


# PROFICIENCIES

A character sheet notes the things that the character is especially good at, which are known as the character's proficiencies. Here are the main proficiencies, along with page references to their rules:

Skills (page 6)                Equipment (page 18)
Saving Throws (page 7)

## USING YOUR PROFICIENCY BONUS

Whenever you make an ability check, a saving throw, or an attack roll that uses one of your character's proficiencies, you add the character's proficiency bonus to the roll. The bonus appears on your character sheet, and this rulebook and the character sheet tell you when the bonus applies.

A monster's proficiency bonus is already incorporated in the relevant numbers in the creature's stat block, so the DM doesn't need to add it.

## THE BONUS DOESN'T STACK

Your proficiency bonus can't be added to a die roll or other number more than once. For example, if two rules tell you to add your proficiency bonus to a Wisdom saving throw, you nevertheless add it only once to the save.

Occasionally, a proficiency bonus might be multiplied or divided (round down) before being added. For example, the rogue's Expertise feature doubles the proficiency bonus for certain ability checks. Whenever used, the bonus can be multiplied only once, divided only once, and added only once.

# ADVANTAGE & DISADVANTAGE

Sometimes a rule, such as a class feature or a spell, says you have advantage or disadvantage on an ability check, a saving throw, or an attack roll. When that happens, roll the d20 twice when you make the roll. Use the higher of the two rolls if you have advantage, and use the lower roll if you have disadvantage.

For example, if you have disadvantage and roll a 17 and a 5, you use the 5. If you instead have advantage and roll those numbers, you use the 17.

## THEY DON'T STACK

If multiple situations affect a roll and each one grants advantage or imposes disadvantage on it, you don't roll the d20 more than one additional time. If two favorable situations grant advantage, for example, you still roll only one additional time.

If circumstances cause a roll to have both advantage and disadvantage, you are considered to have neither of them, and you roll the d20 once. This is true even if multiple circumstances impose disadvantage and only one grants advantage or vice versa. In such a situation, you have neither advantage nor disadvantage.

## INTERACTIONS WITH REROLLS

When you have advantage or disadvantage and something in the game, such as the halfling's Lucky trait, lets you reroll or replace the d20, you can reroll or replace only one of the rolls. You choose which one. For example, if a halfling has advantage or disadvantage on an ability check and rolls a 1 and a 13, the halfling could use the Lucky trait to reroll the 1.

# ABILITY CHECKS

An ability check tests a character's or monster's innate talent and training in an effort to overcome a challenge. The DM calls for an ability check when a character or monster attempts an action (other than an attack) that has a chance of failure. When the outcome is uncertain, the dice determine the results.

## MAKING AN ABILITY CHECK

Here are the steps for making an ability check:

**1: Determine the ability to use.** For every ability check, the DM decides which of the six abilities is relevant to the task at hand. This rulebook or the adventure booklet often tells the DM what kind of check a character can make and what happens if the check succeeds or fails. Since characters often try unpredictable things, the adventure booklet also provides advice to help the DM decide what kind of ability check to use in a situation.


**2: Choose a skill that applies, if any.** Each ability, except Constitution, has skills associated with it, and the rules or the DM determines which of those skills is relevant to a check. See the "Skills" section below for more information.

**3: Set the Difficulty Class.** Each ability check requires a DC, representing the difficulty of the task. The more difficult a task, the higher its DC. This rulebook, the adventure booklet, and the character sheets provide guidance on what the DC should be for certain checks.

**4: Roll the d20.** Then add the relevant ability modifier, and if the check uses one of the character's skill proficiencies, add the character's proficiency bonus too. As with other d20 rolls, apply any bonuses and penalties, and compare the total to the DC. If the total equals or exceeds the DC, the ability check is a success. Otherwise, it's a failure, which means the character or monster makes no progress toward the objective or makes progress combined with a setback determined by the DM.

# SKILLS

Each of the six abilities covers a range of capabilities, including skills that a character or a monster can be proficient in. A skill represents a specific aspect of an ability score, and an individual's proficiency in a skill demonstrates a focus on that aspect. The character sheets indicate each character's skill proficiencies, and a monster's skill proficiencies appear in the monster's stat block.

## SKILLS

| Ability      | Skill           | Example Uses                                                                      |
| ------------ | --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Strength     | Athletics       | Jump farther than normal, stay afloat in rough water, or break something.         |
| Dexterity    | Acrobatics      | Stay on your feet in a tricky situation, or perform an acrobatic stunt.           |
|              | Sleight of Hand | Pick someone's pocket, conceal a handheld object, or perform legerdemain.         |
|              | Stealth         | Escape notice by moving silently and hiding behind things.                        |
| Intelligence | Arcana          | Recall lore about spells, magic items, and the planes of existence.               |
|              | History         | Recall lore about historical events, people, nations, and cultures.               |
|              | Investigation   | Find obscure information in books, or deduce clues about how something works.     |
|              | Nature          | Recall lore about terrain, plants, animals, and weather.                          |
|              | Religion        | Recall lore about gods, religious rituals, and holy symbols.                      |
| Wisdom       | Animal Handling | Intuit an animal's intentions, calm an animal, or train an animal.                |
|              | Insight         | Discern a person's mood and intentions.                                           |
|              | Medicine        | Diagnose an illness, or determine what killed the recently slain.                 |
|              | Perception      | Using a combination of senses, notice something that's easy to miss.              |
|              | Survival        | Follow tracks, forage, find your way in the wilderness, or avoid natural hazards. |
| Charisma     | Deception       | Tell a convincing lie, or wear a disguise convincingly.                           |
|              | Intimidation    | Awe or threaten someone into doing what you want.                                 |
|              | Performance     | Perform music, dance, acting, or storytelling.                                    |
|              | Persuasion      | Honestly and graciously convince someone of something.                            |


For example, a Dexterity check might reflect a character's attempt to pull off an acrobatic stunt, to palm an object, or to stay hidden. Each of these aspects of Dexterity has an associated skill: Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth, respectively. So a character who has proficiency in the Stealth skill is particularly good at Dexterity checks related to sneaking and hiding.

## HOW TO USE SKILL PROFICIENCIES

Sometimes, the DM might ask for an ability check using a specific skill—for example, "Make a Wisdom (Insight) check." At other times, a player might ask the DM if proficiency in a particular skill applies to a check. In either case, proficiency in a skill means an individual can add their proficiency bonus to ability checks that involve that skill. Without proficiency in the skill, the individual still makes the ability check but without adding their proficiency bonus.

For example, if a character attempts to climb up a dangerous cliff, the Dungeon Master might ask for a Strength (Athletics) check. If the character is proficient in Athletics, the character's proficiency bonus is added to the Strength check. If the character lacks that proficiency, they just make a Strength check.

## SKILL LIST

The skills related to each ability score are shown on the Skills table (no skills are related to Constitution). That table also notes example uses for each skill proficiency.


# WORKING TOGETHER

Sometimes two or more characters team up to attempt a task. The character who's leading the effort—or the one with the highest ability modifier—can make an ability check with advantage, reflecting the help provided by the other characters. In combat, this requires the Help action (page 12).

A character can provide help only if the task is one they could attempt alone. For example, the rules might require proficiency with thieves' tools to pick a specific lock, so a character who lacks that proficiency couldn't help another character in that task. Moreover, a character can help only when two or more individuals working together would actually be productive. Some tasks, such as threading a needle, are no easier with help.

# SAVING THROWS

A saving throw—also called a save—represents an attempt to resist certain threats, such as a spell or a trap. A rule or the DM tells you when it's time to make a save for a creature, following these steps:

**1: Determine the ability to use.** The rules or the DM determines which of the six abilities to use for the save. For example, the DM might say, "Make a Dexterity saving throw to dodge the fire!"

**2: Set the Difficulty Class.** The DC for a saving throw is determined by the effect that causes it. For example, the DC for a saving throw allowed by a spell is determined by the caster's spellcasting ability modifier and proficiency bonus, as explained in chapter 3.

**3: Roll the d20.** Then add the appropriate ability modifier. For example, you use your Dexterity modifier for a Dexterity saving throw. If the creature has the relevant saving throw proficiency (noted on the character sheet or stat block), also add the creature's proficiency bonus. As with other d20 rolls, apply any other bonuses and penalties, and compare the total to the DC. If the total equals or exceeds the DC, the save is a success. Otherwise, it's a failure. The result of a successful or failed saving throw is detailed in the description of the effect that forced the save.

# SOCIAL INTERACTION

During their adventures, the player's characters meet people from many different walks of life and face monsters that are more keen to talk than fight. In those situations, it's time for social interaction.

Interaction takes on many forms. You might need to convince an unscrupulous thief to confess to some wrongdoing, or you might try to flatter a dragon so that it will spare your life. The DM assumes the roles of any NPCs who are participating.

## ALIGNMENT

Characters and many monsters have an alignment, which broadly describes their moral and ethical attitudes. Alignment is a combination of two factors: one identifies morality (good, evil, or neutral), and the other describes attitudes toward society and order (lawful, chaotic, or neutral). Thus, nine distinct alignments define the possible combinations.

Creatures that lack the capacity for rational thought don't have alignments—they are **unaligned**. Such creatures are incapable of making moral or ethical choices and act according to their natures.

These summaries of the nine alignments describe the typical behavior of a creature with that alignment; individuals vary from that behavior:

**Lawful good** (LG) creatures can be counted on to do the right thing as expected by society.

**Neutral good** (NG) folk do the best they can to help others according to their needs.

**Chaotic good** (CG) creatures act as their conscience directs, with little regard for what others expect.

**Lawful neutral** (LN) individuals act in accordance with law, tradition, or personal codes.

**Neutral** (N) is the alignment of those who steer clear of moral questions, doing what seems best at the time.

**Chaotic neutral** (CN) creatures follow their whims, holding their personal freedom above all else.

**Lawful evil** (LE) creatures take what they want, within the limits of a code of tradition, loyalty, or order.

**Neutral evil** (NE) is the alignment of those who do whatever they can get away with, without qualms.

**Chaotic evil** (CE) creatures act with arbitrary violence, spurred by their greed, hatred, or bloodlust.

In general terms, an NPC's attitude toward you is described as friendly, indifferent, or hostile. Friendly NPCs are predisposed to help you, and hostile ones are inclined to get in your way. It's easier to get what you want from a friendly NPC.

Social interactions have two primary aspects: roleplaying and ability checks.

## ROLEPLAYING

Roleplaying is, literally, the act of playing out a role. In this case, it's you as a player determining how your character thinks, acts, and talks. Roleplaying is part of every aspect of the game, and it comes to the fore during social interactions. Your character's personality influences how interactions resolve.

The DM uses your character's actions and attitudes to determine how an NPC reacts. A cowardly bandit might buckle under threats of imprisonment. A stubborn merchant refuses to let anyone badger her. A vain dragon laps up flattery.

When interacting with an NPC, pay close attention to the DM's portrayal of the NPC's personality. You might be able to determine an NPC's goals and then play on them to influence the NPC's attitude.


If you offer NPCs something they want or play on their sympathies, fears, or goals, you can use words to form friendships, ward off violence, or learn a key piece of information. On the other hand, if you insult a proud warrior or speak ill of a noble's allies, your efforts to convince or deceive will likely fall short.

## ABILITY CHECKS

In addition to roleplaying, ability checks can be key in determining the outcome of a social interaction. Your roleplaying efforts can alter an NPC's attitude, but there might still be an element of chance in the situation. For example, your DM can call for a Charisma check at any point during an interaction if they want the dice to play a role in determining an NPC's reactions. Other checks might be appropriate in certain situations, at your DM's discretion.

Pay attention to your skill proficiencies when thinking of how you want to interact with an NPC, and stack the deck in your favor by using an approach that relies on your skills. For example, if the group needs to trick a guard into letting them into a castle, the rogue who is proficient in Deception is the best bet to lead the discussion.

# THE ENVIRONMENT

Adventuring involves delving into places that are dangerous and full of mysteries. The rules in this section cover some of the ways adventurers interact with the environment in such places.

## TRAVEL

During an adventure, the characters might travel long distances, on trips that could take hours or days. The DM can summarize this travel without calculating exact distances or travel times.

If you need to know how fast people can move when every second matters, use the "Movement & Position" rules (page 11).

## FALLING

A creature that falls takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage at the end of the fall for every 10 feet it fell, to a maximum of 20d6 (see page 15 for the rules on taking damage).

When the creature lands, it suffers the prone condition (explained in the appendix), unless it avoids taking any damage from the fall.

A creature that falls into water or another liquid can use its reaction (see "Reactions" on page 10) to make a DC 15 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to hit the surface head or feet first. On a successful check, any damage resulting from the fall is halved.

# VISION

Some of the tasks of adventuring—noticing danger, finding hidden objects, hitting an enemy in combat, and targeting a spell, to name just a few—rely on a creature's ability to see. Darkness and other effects that obscure vision can prove a hindrance, as explained below.

## OBSCURED AREAS

An area might be lightly or heavily obscured. In a **lightly obscured** area, such as dim light, patchy fog, or moderate foliage, creatures have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

A **heavily obscured** area—such as darkness, opaque fog, or dense foliage—blocks vision within it. A creature effectively suffers the blinded condition (explained in the appendix) when trying to see something in that area.

## LIGHT

The presence or absence of light in an environment creates three categories of illumination:

**Bright light** lets most creatures see normally. Even gloomy days provide bright light, as do torches, lanterns, fires, and other sources of illumination within a specific radius.

**Dim light**, also called shadows, creates a lightly obscured area. An area of dim light is usually a boundary between a source of bright light, such as a torch, and surrounding darkness. The soft light of twilight and dawn also counts as dim light. A full moon might bathe the land in dim light.

**Darkness** creates a heavily obscured area. Characters face darkness outdoors at night (even most moonlit nights), within the confines of an unlit dungeon, or in an area of magical darkness.

## HIDING

Adventurers and monsters often hide, whether to spy on one another or to set an ambush. The DM decides when circumstances are appropriate for hiding. When you try to hide, make a Dexterity (Stealth) check. Until you are discovered or stop hiding, that check's total becomes the DC for the Wisdom (Perception) check of any creature that searches the area; it finds you only if the check succeeds.

### WHEN CAN I HIDE?

You can try to hide if no one can see you. You can't hide from a creature that can see you clearly, and you give away your position if you make noise, such as shouting a warning or making an attack.

An invisible creature can't be seen, so it can always try to hide. Signs of its passage might be noticed, however, and it still has to stay quiet. For more information, see the invisible condition in the appendix.


# PASSIVE PERCEPTION

When you hide, there's a chance someone will notice you even if they aren't searching. To determine whether such a creature notices you, the DM compares your Dexterity (Stealth) check with that creature's passive Wisdom (Perception) score, which equals 10 + the creature's Wisdom modifier, as well as any other bonuses or penalties. If the creature has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks, add 5. For disadvantage on such checks, subtract 5.

For example, if a 1st-level character (with a proficiency bonus of +2) has a Wisdom score of 15 (a +2 modifier) and proficiency in Perception, the character has a passive Wisdom (Perception) of 14.

# INTERACTING WITH OBJECTS

A character's interaction with objects in an environment is simple to resolve in the game. The player tells the DM that their character is doing something, such as moving a lever, and the DM describes what, if anything, happens.

# FINDING HIDDEN THINGS

When your character searches for a hidden object, such as a secret door or a trap, the DM typically asks you to make a Wisdom (Perception) check. If you succeed, you find the hidden details or other information and clues that you might otherwise overlook.

[Image shows a rogue-like character in medieval fantasy attire standing against a stone wall with a "WANTED" poster visible. The character is equipped with weapons and armor.]

ROGUES LIKE TO AMBUSH THEIR FOES.

In most cases, you need to describe where you are searching. For example, a key is hidden beneath clothes in the top drawer of a bureau. If you tell the DM that you pace around the room, looking at the walls and furniture for clues, you have no chance of finding the key, regardless of your Wisdom (Perception) check result. You would have to specify that you were searching the bureau to have any chance of success.

# SUFFOCATING

A creature can hold its breath for a number of minutes equal to 1 + its Constitution modifier (minimum of 30 seconds). When a creature runs out of breath or is choking, it can survive for a number of rounds equal to its Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 round). At the start of its next turn, it drops to 0 hit points and is dying, and it can't regain hit points or be stabilized until it can breathe again (see page 15 for the rules on taking damage).

# COMBAT

Adventurers encounter many dangerous monsters and nefarious villains. In those moments, combat often breaks out.

## THE ORDER OF COMBAT

A typical combat encounter is a clash between two sides, a flurry of weapon swings, feints, parries, footwork, and spellcasting. The game organizes combat into a cycle of rounds and turns. A round represents about 6 seconds in the game world. During a round, each participant in a battle takes a turn. The order of turns is determined at the beginning of combat, when everyone rolls initiative. Once everyone has taken a turn, the fight continues to the next round if neither side is defeated.

### COMBAT STEP BY STEP

**1: Determine surprise.** The DM determines whether anyone involved in the combat encounter is surprised.

**2: Establish positions.** The DM decides where all the characters and monsters are located. Given the adventurers' marching order or their stated positions in the room or other location, the DM figures out where the adversaries are—how far away and in what direction.

**3: Roll initiative.** Everyone involved in the combat encounter rolls initiative, determining the order of combatants' turns.

**4: Take turns.** Each participant in the battle takes a turn in initiative order.

**5: Begin the next round.** When everyone involved in the combat has had a turn, the round ends. Repeat step 4 and 5 until the fighting stops.


# SURPRISE

Adventurers sneak up on a bandit camp, springing from the trees to attack. A stirge swoops down from a cavern ceiling, unnoticed by the adventurers until it's nearly on them. In these situations, one side of the battle gains surprise over the other.

The DM determines who might be surprised. If neither side tries to be stealthy, they automatically notice each other. Otherwise, the DM compares the Dexterity (Stealth) checks of anyone hiding with the passive Wisdom (Perception) score of each creature on the opposing side. Any creature that fails to notice a threat is surprised at the start of the combat.

If you're surprised, you can't move or take an action on your first turn of the combat, and you can't take a reaction until that turn ends (see the "Your Turn" and "Reactions" sections below for information on actions and reactions). A member of a group can be surprised even if the other members aren't.

# INITIATIVE

Initiative determines the order of turns during combat. When combat starts, every participant makes a Dexterity check to determine their place in the initiative order. The check total is called a combatant's initiative count, or initiative for short. The DM makes one roll for a group of identical creatures, so each member of the group acts at the same time.

The DM ranks the combatants in order, from the one with the highest initiative to the one with the lowest. This is the order in which they act during each round. The initiative order remains the same from round to round.

If a tie occurs, the DM decides the order among tied monsters, and the players decide the order among their tied characters. The DM decides the order if the tie is between a monster and a player character, or the DM can have the tied characters and monsters each roll a die and go in order from highest roll to lowest.

# YOUR TURN

On your turn, you can **move** a distance up to your speed and **take one action**. You decide whether to move first or take your action first. Your speed—sometimes called your walking speed—is noted on your character sheet.

The actions you can take are described in the "Actions in Combat" section later in this chapter. The "Movement & Position" section later in this chapter gives the rules for your move.

*Communicating.* You can communicate however you are able, through brief utterances and gestures, as you take your turn. Doing so uses neither your action nor your move. Some conditions in the game (see the appendix) inhibit communication.

*Interacting with Things.* You can interact with one object or feature of the environment for free, during either your move or your action. For example, you could open a door during your move as you stride toward a foe, or you could draw your weapon as part of the same action you use to attack.

If you want to interact with a second object, you need to take the Use an Object action (see page 13). Some magic items and other special objects always require an action to use, as stated in their descriptions.

The DM might require you to use an action for any of these activities when it needs special care or when it presents an unusual obstacle. For instance, the DM could reasonably expect you to take an action to open a stuck door or turn a crank to lower a drawbridge.

*Doing Nothing on Your Turn.* You can forgo moving, taking an action, or doing anything at all on your turn. If you can't decide what to do, consider taking the Dodge or Ready action, as described in the "Actions in Combat" section later in this chapter.

# BONUS ACTIONS

Various class features, spells, and other abilities let you take an additional action on your turn called a bonus action. The Cunning Action feature, for example, allows a rogue to take a bonus action. You can take a bonus action only when a special ability, spell, or other feature of the game states that you can do something as a bonus action. You otherwise don't have a bonus action to take.

You can take only one bonus action on your turn, so you must choose which bonus action to use when you have more than one available.

You choose when to take a bonus action during your turn, unless the bonus action's timing is specified, and anything that deprives you of your ability to take actions also prevents you from taking a bonus action.

# REACTIONS

Certain special abilities, spells, and situations allow you to take a special action called a reaction. A reaction is an instant response to a trigger of some kind, which can occur on your turn or on someone else's. The opportunity attack, described later in this chapter, is the most common type of reaction.

When you take a reaction, you can't take another one until the start of your next turn. If the reaction interrupts another creature's turn, that creature can continue its turn right after the reaction.

In terms of timing, a reaction takes place immediately after whatever triggered it, unless the description of the reaction says otherwise.


# MOVEMENT & POSITION

On your turn, you can move a distance equal to your speed or less. Or you can decide not to move.

Your movement can include jumping, climbing, and swimming (explained later in this section). These different modes of movement can be combined with walking, or they can constitute your entire move. However you're moving, you deduct the distance of each part of your move from your speed until it is used up or until you are done moving.

## CREATURE SIZE

A creature belongs to a size category. Each size determines the width of the square space the creature occupies on a map, as shown on the Size Categories table. That table lists the sizes from smallest (Tiny) to largest (Gargantuan).

A character's size is specified on the character sheet, and a monster's size is specified in the monster's stat block.

### SIZE CATEGORIES

| Size   | Space         | Size       | Space          |
| ------ | ------------- | ---------- | -------------- |
| Tiny   | 2½ ft. square | Large      | 10 ft. square  |
| Small  | 5 ft. square  | Huge       | 15 ft. square  |
| Medium | 5 ft. square  | Gargantuan | 20+ ft. square |


## BREAKING UP YOUR MOVE

You can break up your movement on your turn, using some of your speed before and after your action. For example, if you have a speed of 30 feet, you could move 10 feet, take your action, and then move 20 feet. Similarly, if you take an action that includes more than one weapon attack, you can break up your movement by moving between those attacks.

If a creature has more than one speed—such as a walking speed and a flying speed—the creature can switch back and forth between the speeds during its move. Whenever it switches, subtract the distance already moved from the new speed. The result determines how much farther the creature can move. If the result is 0 or less, it can't use the new speed during the current move. For example, if a creature (such as a harpy) has a walking speed of 20 and a flying speed of 40, it could fly 10 feet, walk 10 feet, and leap into the air to fly 20 feet more.

## DIFFICULT TERRAIN

Combatants are often slowed down by difficult terrain. Low furniture, rubble, undergrowth, steep stairs, snow, and shallow bogs are examples of difficult terrain. The space of another creature, whether it's hostile or not, also counts as difficult terrain.

Every foot of movement in difficult terrain costs 1 extra foot, even if multiple things in a space count as difficult terrain.

# BEING PRONE

Combatants are often knocked down. They are then prone, a condition described in the appendix.

You can **drop prone** without using any of your speed. Standing up takes more effort; doing so costs an amount of movement equal to half your speed (round down). For example, if your speed is 30 feet, you must spend 15 feet of movement to stand up. You can't stand up if you don't have enough movement left or if your speed is 0.

## MOVING AROUND OTHER CREATURES

You can move through a friend's space. In contrast, you can move through an enemy's space only if the foe is at least two sizes larger or smaller than you. Remember that another creature's space is difficult terrain for you.

Whether a creature is a friend or an enemy, you can't willingly end your move in its space.

If you leave an enemy's reach during your move, you provoke an opportunity attack (see page 14).

## FLYING

Flying creatures have excellent mobility, but they must also deal with the danger of falling. If a flying creature is knocked prone, has its speed reduced to 0, or is otherwise deprived of the ability to move, the creature falls, unless it has the ability to hover or it is being held aloft by magic.

## CLIMBING, SWIMMING, AND CRAWLING

Each foot of movement costs 1 extra foot (2 extra feet in difficult terrain) when you're climbing, swimming, or crawling. You ignore this extra cost if you have a climbing speed and use it to climb or have a swimming speed and use it to swim.

At the DM's option, climbing a slippery vertical surface or one with few handholds might require a successful Strength (Athletics) check. Similarly, gaining any distance in rough water might require a successful Strength (Athletics) check.

## LONG JUMPS

When you make a long jump, you cover a number of feet up to your Strength score if you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing long jump, you can leap only half that distance. Either way, each foot you clear on the jump costs a foot of movement.

This rule assumes that the height of your jump doesn't matter, such as a jump across a stream or chasm. At your DM's option, you must succeed on a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check to clear a low obstacle (no taller than a quarter of the jump's distance), such as a low wall. Otherwise, you hit it.

When you land in difficult terrain, you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to land on your feet. Otherwise, you land prone.


# HIGH JUMPS

When you make a high jump, you leap into the air a number of feet equal to 3 + your Strength modifier (minimum of 0 feet) if you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing high jump, you can jump only half that distance. Either way, each foot you clear on the jump costs a foot of movement. In some circumstances, your DM might allow you to make a Strength (Athletics) check to jump higher than you normally can.

You can extend your arms half your height above yourself during the jump. Thus, you can reach above yourself a distance equal to the height of the jump plus 1½ times your height.

# ACTIONS IN COMBAT

When you take your action on your turn, you can take one of the actions presented here. When you describe an action not detailed here, the DM tells what kind of roll you need to make, if any, to determine success or failure.

## ATTACK

The most common action to take in combat is the Attack action. With this action, you make one attack with a weapon or an unarmed strike. See the "Making an Attack" section for the rules that govern attacks.

## CAST A SPELL

Most spells require an action to cast. See chapter 3 for the rules on casting a spell.

## DASH

When you take the Dash action, you gain extra movement for the current turn. The increase equals your speed, after applying any modifiers. With a speed of 30 feet, for example, you can move up to 60 feet on your turn if you take the Dash action.

## DISENGAGE

If you take the Disengage action, your movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks (see page 14) for the rest of the turn.

## DODGE

When you take the Dodge action, you focus on avoiding attacks. Until the start of your next turn, any attack roll made against you has disadvantage if you can see the attacker, and you make Dexterity saving throws with advantage. You lose this benefit if you receive the incapacitated condition (explained in the appendix) or if your speed is reduced to 0 by a condition or another effect.

[Image: A wizard figure standing next to a stack of books with a staff and candle, with caption "WIZARDS OFTEN TAKE THE CAST A SPELL ACTION."]

## HELP

You can lend your aid to another creature in the completion of a task. When you take the Help action, the creature you aid gains advantage on the next ability check it makes to perform the task you are helping with, provided that it makes the check before the start of your next turn.

Alternatively, you can make it easier to hit a creature within 5 feet of you by distracting the target, such as with a feint. You thereby give advantage to the next attack roll against the target that is made by one of your allies before your next turn.

## HIDE

When you take the Hide action, you make a Dexterity (Stealth) check in an attempt to hide, following the rules on page 8 for hiding. If you succeed, you gain the benefits described in the "Unseen Attackers and Targets" section later in this chapter.

## READY

Sometimes you want to wait for a particular circumstance before you act. To do so, you take the Ready action on your turn, which lets you act using your reaction before the start of your next turn.

First, you decide what perceivable circumstance will trigger your reaction. Then you choose the action you will take in response to that trigger, or you choose to move up to your speed in response to it. Examples include "If the cultist steps on the trapdoor, I'll pull the lever that opens it," and "If the zombie steps next to me, I'll move away."

When the trigger occurs, you can either take your reaction right after the trigger finishes or ignore it.


When you ready a spell, you cast it as normal but hold its energy, which you release with your reaction when the trigger occurs. To be readied, a spell must have a casting time of 1 action, and holding on to the spell's magic requires concentration (explained in chapter 3). If your concentration is broken, the readied spell dissipates without taking effect.

## SEARCH

When you take the Search action, you devote your attention to finding something, and the DM might have you make a Wisdom (Perception) check or an Intelligence (Investigation) check.

## USE A MAGIC ITEM

If you have a magic item that requires an action to use, you take the Use a Magic Item action.

## USE AN OBJECT

You normally interact with an object while doing something else, such as when you draw a sword as part of an attack. When a nonmagical object requires your action, you take the Use an Object action. You can also take this action to interact with more than one object on your turn.

## USE A SPECIAL ABILITY

Many class features give you special ways to use your action. Monsters also have their own special actions, as detailed in their stat blocks.

## MAKING AN ATTACK

When you take the Attack action, you can make a weapon attack. If you take the Cast a Spell action, some spells involve making a spell attack, and the Use a Magic Item, Use an Object, and Use a Special Ability actions sometimes involve an item or a feature that requires an attack.

### TWO ATTACK TYPES

There are two types of attacks in the game: **weapon attacks** and **spell attacks**. The rules tell you an attack's type and whether the type matters in a particular situation. Weapon attacks are generally physical attacks with weapons (listed in chapter 2) and the like. Spell attacks involve spells and other forms of magic.

Regardless of an attack's type, it follows the rules in this section, and if there's ever any question whether something you're doing counts as an attack, the rule is simple: if you're making an attack roll, you're making an attack.

### ATTACK STRUCTURE

Whether you're striking with a melee weapon, firing a weapon at range, or making an attack roll as part of a spell, an attack has the following structure:

**1: Choose a target.** Pick a target within your attack's range: a creature, an object, or a location.

**2: Determine modifiers.** The DM determines whether the target has cover and whether you have advantage or disadvantage against the target. In addition, spells, special abilities, and other effects can apply penalties or bonuses to your attack roll.

**3: Resolve the attack.** Make the attack roll. On a hit, you roll damage, unless the particular attack has rules that specify otherwise. Some attacks cause special effects in addition to or instead of damage.

### ATTACK ROLLS

When you make an attack, your attack roll determines whether the attack hits or misses. To make an attack roll, roll a d20 and add the appropriate modifiers. If the total of the roll plus modifiers equals or exceeds the target's Armor Class (AC), the attack hits.

When a character makes an attack roll, the two most common modifiers to the roll are an ability modifier and the character's proficiency bonus. When a monster makes an attack roll, it uses whatever modifier is provided in its stat block.

**Ability Modifier.** The ability modifier used for a melee weapon attack is Strength, and the ability modifier used for a ranged weapon attack is Dexterity.

Some spells also require an attack roll. The ability modifier used for a spell attack depends on the spellcasting ability of the spellcaster, as specified on the spellcaster's character sheet or in its stat block. See chapter 3 for more information on spellcasting.

**Proficiency Bonus.** You add your proficiency bonus to your attack roll when you attack using a weapon you have proficiency with, as well as when you attack with a spell.

### ROLLING 1 OR 20

If an attack roll gets a 20 on the d20, the attack hits regardless of any modifiers or the target's AC. This is called a critical hit, which is explained later in this chapter.

If an attack roll gets a 1 on the d20, the attack misses regardless of any modifiers or the target's AC.

### UNSEEN ATTACKERS AND TARGETS

When you make an attack roll against a target you can't see, you have disadvantage on the roll. This is true whether you're guessing the target's location or you're targeting a creature you can hear but not see. If the target isn't in the location you targeted, you automatically miss, but the DM typically just says that the attack missed, not whether you guessed the target's location correctly.


# RANGED ATTACKS

When you make a ranged attack, you fire a bow or a crossbow, hurl a handaxe, or otherwise send projectiles to strike a foe at a distance. Many spells also involve making a ranged attack.

## RANGE

You can make ranged attacks only against targets within a specified range. If a ranged attack, such as one made with a spell, has a single range, you can't attack a target beyond this range.

Some ranged attacks, such as those made with a longbow or a shortbow, have two ranges. The smaller number is the normal range, and the larger number is the long range. Your attack roll has disadvantage when your target is beyond normal range, and you can't attack a target beyond the long range.

## RANGED ATTACKS IN CLOSE COMBAT

Aiming a ranged attack is more difficult when a foe is next to you. When you make a ranged attack with a weapon, a spell, or some other means, you have disadvantage on the attack roll if you are within 5 feet of an enemy who can see you and who isn't incapacitated.

# MELEE ATTACKS

Used in hand-to-hand combat, a melee attack allows you to attack a foe within your reach. A melee attack typically uses a handheld weapon. A typical monster makes a melee attack when it strikes with its claws, its horns, its teeth, or another body part. A few spells also involve making a melee attack.

## REACH

A creature has a 5-foot reach and can thus attack targets within 5 feet of them when making a melee attack. Certain creatures have melee attacks with a reach greater than 5 feet, as noted in their descriptions.

## OPPORTUNITY ATTACKS

Combatants constantly watch for enemies to drop their guard. When you move heedlessly past your foes, you put yourself in danger; doing so provokes an opportunity attack.

**Making an Opportunity Attack.** You can make an opportunity attack when an enemy that you can see leaves your reach. To make the opportunity attack, you use your reaction to make one melee weapon attack against the provoking creature. The attack occurs right before the creature leaves your reach.

**Avoiding Opportunity Attacks.** You can avoid provoking an opportunity attack by taking the Disengage action. You also don't provoke an opportunity attack when you teleport or when someone or something moves you without using your movement,

HALF COVER AND THREE-QUARTERS COVER

When a creature can't see you, you have advantage on attack rolls against it.

If you are hidden—both unseen and unheard—when you make an attack, you give away your location when the attack hits or misses.

# COVER

Walls, trees, creatures, and other obstacles can provide cover, making a target more difficult to harm. As detailed in the Cover table, there are three degrees of cover, each of which gives a different benefit to a target.

A target can benefit from cover only when an attack or other effect originates on the opposite side of the cover. If a target is behind multiple sources of cover, only the most protective degree of cover applies; the degrees aren't added together. For example, if a target is behind a creature that gives half cover and a tree trunk that gives three-quarters cover, the target has three-quarters cover.

## COVER

| Cover Degree   | Benefit to Target                          | Offered By                                                                        |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Half           | +2 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws | Another creature of any size or an object that covers at least half of the target |
| Three-quarters | +5 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws | An object that covers at least three-quarters of the target                       |
| Total          | Can't be targeted directly                 | An object that covers the whole target                                            |





action, or reaction. For example, you don't provoke an opportunity attack if an explosion hurls you out of a foe's reach or if you fall past an enemy.

## GRAPPLING

When you want to grab a creature or wrestle with it, you can use the Attack action to make a special melee attack, a grapple.

*Starting a Grapple.* The target of your grapple must be no more than one size larger than you, and it must be within your reach. Using at least one free hand, you try to seize the target by making a grapple check—a Strength (Athletics) check with a DC set by a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check the target makes in response (the target chooses the ability to use). You succeed automatically if the target is incapacitated.

If you succeed, you subject the target to the grappled condition (see the appendix). The condition specifies the things that end it, and you can release the target whenever you like (no action required).

*Escaping a Grapple.* A grappled creature can use its action to escape. To do so, it must succeed on a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check with a DC set by a Strength (Athletics) check you make when it tries to escape.

*Moving a Grappled Creature.* When you move, you can drag or carry the grappled creature with you, but your speed is halved (round down) unless the creature is two or more sizes smaller than you.

## SHOVING A CREATURE

Using the Attack action, you can make a special melee attack to shove a creature, either to knock it prone or to push it away from you.

The target of your shove must be no more than one size larger than you, and it must be within your reach. You make a Strength (Athletics) check with a DC set by a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check that the target makes in response (the target chooses the ability to use). You succeed automatically if the target is incapacitated.

If you succeed, you either knock the target prone or push it 5 feet away from you (your choice).

## UNARMED STRIKES

Instead of using a weapon to make a melee attack, you can use an unarmed strike: a punch, kick, headbutt, or similar forceful blow. On a hit, an unarmed strike deals bludgeoning damage equal to 1 + your Strength modifier.

You are proficient with your unarmed strikes. They aren't considered weapons by the rules, but they nonetheless work for melee weapon attacks.

# DAMAGE & HEALING

Injury and death are constant threats in D&D, as detailed in the following rules.

## HIT POINTS

Every creature has hit points, which represent a combination of physical and mental durability, the will to live, and luck. Creatures with more hit points are more difficult to kill. Those with fewer hit points are more fragile.

A creature's current hit points (usually just called hit points) can be any number from the creature's hit point maximum down to 0, and it never goes lower than 0. This number changes frequently as a creature takes damage or receives healing.

Whenever a creature takes damage, that damage is subtracted from its hit points. The loss of hit points has no effect on a creature's capabilities until the creature drops to 0 hit points.

## DAMAGE ROLLS

Each weapon, spell, and harmful monster ability specifies the damage it deals, if any. You roll the damage die or dice, add any modifiers, and apply the damage to your target (minimum of 0 damage).

When attacking with a **weapon**, you add your ability modifier—the same modifier used for the attack roll—to the damage. A **spell** tells you which dice to roll for damage and whether to add any modifiers.

If a spell or other effect deals damage to **more than one target** at the same time, roll the damage once for all of them. For example, when a wizard casts *thunderwave*, the spell's damage is rolled once for all creatures caught in the blast.

## CRITICAL HITS

When you score a critical hit, you get to roll extra dice for the attack's damage against the target. Roll all of the attack's damage dice twice and add them together. Then add any relevant modifiers as normal.

For example, if you score a critical hit with a dagger, roll 2d4 for the damage, rather than 1d4, and then add your relevant ability modifier. If the attack involves other damage dice, such as from the rogue's Sneak Attack feature, you roll those dice twice as well.

## DAMAGE TYPES

Every instance of damage has a type. Damage types have no rules of their own, but other rules, such as damage resistance, rely on the types.

The types are acid, bludgeoning, cold, fire, force, lightning, necrotic, piercing, poison, psychic, radiant, slashing, and thunder.


# DAMAGE RESISTANCE AND VULNERABILITY

Some creatures and objects are exceedingly difficult or easy to hurt with certain types of damage. If a creature or an object has **resistance** to a damage type, damage of that type is halved against it (round down). If a creature or an object has **vulnerability** to a damage type, damage of that type is doubled against it.

After all other modifiers to damage, resistance is applied and then vulnerability. For example, 25 bludgeoning damage is dealt to a creature that has bludgeoning resistance. The creature is also within a magical aura that reduces all damage by 5. The 25 damage is first reduced by 5 and then halved, so the creature takes 10 damage.

Multiple instances of resistance or vulnerability that affect the same damage type count as only one instance. For example, if a creature has resistance to fire damage as well as resistance to all nonmagical damage, the damage of a nonmagical fire is reduced only by half against the creature.

# HEALING

Unless it results in death, damage isn't permanent. Even death is reversible through powerful magic. Rest can restore a creature's hit points (see page 17), and magical methods, such as the *cure wounds* spell, can remove damage in an instant.

When a creature receives healing of any kind, hit points regained are added to its current hit points. A creature's hit points can't exceed its hit point maximum, so any hit points regained in excess of this number are lost. For example, a cleric grants a

fighter 8 hit points of healing. If the fighter has 14 current hit points and has a hit point maximum of 20, the fighter regains 6 hit points, not 8.

A creature that has died can't regain hit points until magic has restored it to life.

# DROPPING TO 0 HIT POINTS

When a character drops to 0 hit points, they either die outright or fall unconscious, as explained below. A monster dies when it drops to 0 hit points, unless the DM decides to treat the monster like a character.

*Instant Death.* Massive damage can kill a character instantly. When damage reduces a character to 0 hit points and there is damage remaining, the character dies if the remaining damage equals or exceeds their hit point maximum. For example, a wizard with a maximum of 12 hit points currently has 6 hit points. If the wizard takes 18 damage from an attack, the wizard is reduced to 0 hit points, but 12 damage remains. Because the remaining damage equals the hit point maximum, the wizard dies.

*Falling Unconscious.* If damage reduces a character to 0 hit points and isn't fatal, the character falls unconscious (see the appendix). This unconsciousness ends if the character regains any hit points.

*Death Saving Throws.* Whenever your character starts their turn with 0 hit points, you must make a special saving throw, called a death saving throw, to determine whether the character creeps closer to death. Unlike other saving throws, this one isn't tied to any ability score; the character is now in the hands of fate.

Roll a d20. The save succeeds on a roll of 10 or higher. Otherwise, it fails. A success or failure has no effect by itself. On the third success, the character becomes stable (see below). On the third failure, the character dies. The successes and failures don't need to be consecutive; keep track of both until you collect three of a kind. The number of both is reset to zero when the character regains any hit points or become stable.

When you make a death saving throw and roll a 1 on the d20, it counts as two failures. If you roll a 20 on the d20, your character regains 1 hit point.

*Damage at 0 Hit Points.* If a character takes any damage while at 0 hit points, the character suffers one death saving throw failure. If the damage is from a critical hit, it's two failures instead. If the damage equals or exceeds the character's hit point maximum, the character dies instantly.

*Stabilizing a Creature.* The best way to save a creature with 0 hit points is to heal it. If healing is unavailable, the creature can at least be stabilized so that it isn't killed by a failed death saving throw.

As an action, you can administer first aid to a creature with 0 hit points, which requires a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check. On a success, the


creature is **stable**, which means the creature doesn't make death saving throws, even though it has 0 hit points, but it does remain unconscious. The creature stops being stable, and must start making death saving throws again, if it takes any damage.

A stable creature that isn't healed regains 1 hit point after 1d4 hours.

## Knocking a Creature Out

When an attacker reduces a creature to 0 hit points with a melee attack, the attacker can knock the creature out. The attacker makes this choice the instant the damage is dealt. The creature suffers the unconscious condition (see the appendix) and is stable.

## Harming Objects

Creatures can damage objects with weapons and spells. The DM determines an object's Armor Class and hit points. Objects are immune to poison and psychic damage, and the DM might decide that certain objects have resistance or immunity to other types of damage (it's hard to cut a rope with bludgeoning damage, for example). Objects always fail Strength and Dexterity saving throws, and they are immune to effects that require other saves. When an object drops to 0 hit points, it breaks.

A creature can also make a Strength check to try to break an object, with a DC set by the DM.

# Mounted Combat

A willing creature that is at least one size larger than a rider and that has an appropriate anatomy can serve as a mount, using the following rules:

**Mounting and Dismounting.** During your move, you can mount a creature that is within 5 feet of you or dismount. Doing so costs an amount of movement equal to half your speed (round down). For example, if your speed is 30 feet, you must spend 15 feet of movement to mount a horse.

**Falling Off.** If an effect moves your mount against its will while you're on it, you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or be dismounted, landing prone in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of it. If you're knocked prone while mounted, you must make the same save. If your mount is knocked prone, you can use your reaction to dismount it as it falls and land on your feet. Otherwise, you are dismounted and fall prone in an unoccupied space within 5 feet it.

**Controlling a Mount.** You can control a mount only if it has been trained to accept a rider. Domesticated horses, donkeys, and similar creatures are assumed to have such training. The initiative of a controlled mount changes to match yours when you mount it. It moves as you direct it, and it has only three action options: Dash, Disengage, and Dodge. A controlled mount can move and act even

on the turn that you mount it. In contrast, an independent mount retains its place in the initiative order, and it moves and acts as it wishes.

**Opportunity Attacks against You.** If the mount you're riding provokes an opportunity attack, the attacker can target you or the mount.

# Underwater Combat

A fight underwater follows these rules:

**Impeded Melee.** When making a melee weapon attack, a creature that lacks a swimming speed has disadvantage on the attack roll unless the weapon is a dagger, javelin, shortsword, spear, or trident.

**Reduced Range.** A ranged weapon attack automatically misses a target beyond the weapon's normal range. Even against a target within normal range, the attack roll has disadvantage unless the weapon is a crossbow or a weapon with the thrown property.

**Fire Resistance.** While fully immersed, creatures and objects have resistance to fire damage.

# Resting

Creatures in the game can take short rests in the midst of a day and a long rest to end it.

## Short Rest

A short rest is a period of downtime—at least 1 hour long—during which a creature does nothing more strenuous than eating, drinking, and reading.

A creature can spend one or more Hit Dice at the end of a short rest, up to the creature's maximum number of Hit Dice (noted in the character sheet or stat block). For each Hit Die spent in this way, the player rolls the die and adds the creature's Constitution modifier to it. The creature regains hit points equal to the total (minimum of 0). The player can decide to spend an additional Hit Die after each roll.

## Long Rest

A long rest is a period of extended downtime—at least 8 hours long—during which a creature sleeps for at least 6 hours and performs no more than 2 hours of light activity, such as reading, talking, eating, or standing watch. If the rest is interrupted by a period of strenuous activity—at least 1 hour of walking, fighting, casting spells, or similar activity—the creature must restart the rest to gain any benefit.

At the end of a long rest, a creature regains all lost hit points. The creature also regains spent Hit Dice, up to half of the creature's total number of them (round down; minimum of one die).

A creature can't benefit from more than one long rest in a 24-hour period, and a creature must have at least 1 hit point at the start of the rest to gain its benefits.



CHAPTER 2
EQUIPMENT

# CHAPTER 2
# EQUIPMENT

Adventurers acquire many kinds of equipment on their journeys. This chapter describes equipment that appears on a character sheet and that can be added to the sheet later. Characters gain most of their equipment by buying it in a shop or finding it in a dungeon. Adventurers also sometimes find magic items, the details of which the DM provides.

## COINS

Characters find coins on their adventures and can spend those coins in shops, inns, and other businesses they visit. Coins come in different denominations based on the relative worth of their material. The Coin Values table lists the coins and how much they're worth relative to one another. For example, it shows that a gold piece is worth 100 copper pieces.

A coin weighs about a third of an ounce, so fifty coins weigh a pound.

### COIN VALUES

| Coin          | cp    | sp   | ep   | gp    | pp      |
| ------------- | ----- | ---- | ---- | ----- | ------- |
| Copper (cp)   | 1     | 1/10 | 1/50 | 1/100 | 1/1,000 |
| Silver (sp)   | 10    | 1    | 1/5  | 1/10  | 1/100   |
| Electrum (ep) | 50    | 5    | 1    | 1/2   | 1/20    |
| Gold (gp)     | 100   | 10   | 2    | 1     | 1/10    |
| Platinum (pp) | 1,000 | 100  | 20   | 10    | 1       |


## BUYING & SELLING

This chapter lists the prices of weapons, armor, and other kinds of adventuring gear. The DM lets you know if a shop has a particular item for sale and whether it's available for the standard price.

If you want to sell something, equipment fetches half its cost when sold. Weapons and armor used by monsters are rarely in good enough condition to sell. In contrast, gems, jewelry, and art objects retain their full value in the marketplace, and in most places, magic items are priceless and therefore difficult to sell.

## EQUIPMENT PROFICIENCIES

Anyone can equip the items in this chapter, but the following items require you to have proficiency with the item to unlock all of the item's functionality:

**Armor.** Anyone can don a suit of armor, but only those proficient with it can wear it effectively. Your character sheet lists your character's armor proficiencies. If you wear armor that you lack proficiency with, you have disadvantage on any ability check, saving throw, or attack roll that involves Strength or Dexterity, and you can't cast spells.

**Weapons.** Anyone can wield a weapon, but you must have proficiency with it to add your proficiency bonus to an attack roll you make with it.

**Tools.** Certain tools, such as thieves' tools, require you to have proficiency with the tool to add your proficiency bonus to your ability checks with it.

# ARMOR

The Armor table gives the key details of the various armors available. A creature can wear only one suit of armor at a time. The table lists the cost and weight of the armor, as well as the following details:

**Category.** Every type of armor falls into a category: light, medium, or heavy. The category determines how long it takes to don or doff the armor (as shown in the table), and armor proficiencies are usually tied to one or more of the categories.

**Armor Class (AC).** The table's AC column tells you what your base AC is when you wear a particular type of armor. For example, if you wear leather armor, your AC is 11 plus your Dexterity modifier, whereas your AC is 16 if you wear chain mail.

**Strength.** If the table shows a Strength score in the Strength column for an armor type, that armor reduces the wearer's speed by 10 feet unless the wearer has a Strength score equal to or higher than the listed score.

**Stealth.** If the table shows "Disadvantage" in the Stealth column, the wearer has disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.

# WEAPONS

The Weapons table shows the game's most common weapons. A creature must have a weapon in hand to wield it. The table lists the cost and weight of the weapon, as well as the following details:

**Category.** Every weapon falls into a category: simple or martial. Weapon proficiencies are usually tied to one of these categories. For example, you might have proficiency with simple weapons.

**Melee or Ranged.** A weapon is classified as either melee or ranged. A melee weapon is used to attack a target within 5 feet, whereas a ranged weapon is made to attack at a greater distance.

**Damage.** The table lists the amount of damage a weapon deals when an attacker hits with it.

**Properties.** If a weapon has a property, that property is listed in the Properties column. Each property is defined in the "Weapon Properties" section.

# WEAPON PROPERTIES

Here are definitions of the properties in the Properties column of the Weapons table:

**Ammunition.** You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from it. Each attack expends one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). After a fight, you can spend 1 minute to recover half the ammunition (round down) you used in the fight.

**Finesse.** When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

**Heavy.** Small and Tiny creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls with weapons that have the heavy property.

**Light.** When you take the Attack action and attack with a weapon that has the light property, you can use a bonus action to attack with a different weapon that has the light property in your other hand. Don't add your ability modifier to the bonus attack's damage, unless the modifier is negative.

**Loading.** You can fire only one piece of ammunition from a loading weapon when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

| *Martial Ranged Weapons* |                 |                                                        |       |        |
| Crossbow, hand           | 1d6 piercing    | Ammunition (range 30/120), light, loading              | 75 gp | 3 lb   |
| Crossbow, heavy          | 1d10 piercing   | Ammunition (range 100/400), heavy, loading, two-handed | 50 gp | 18 lb  |

**Range.** A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's long range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

**Reach.** A reach weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for opportunity attacks with it.

**Thrown.** If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property.

**Two-Handed.** This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

**Versatile.** This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property. That's the damage dealt when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.


# IMPROVISED WEAPONS

An improvised weapon is an object wielded as a makeshift weapon, such as broken glass, a table leg, or a frying pan. Even a simple or martial weapon counts as an improvised weapon if it's wielded in a way contrary to its design; if you use a ranged weapon to make a melee attack or throw a melee weapon that lacks the thrown property, the weapon counts as an improvised weapon for that attack.

Here are the rules for an improvised weapon:

**Proficiency.** You don't add your proficiency bonus to attack rolls with it.

**Damage.** On a hit, the weapon deals 1d4 damage of a type the DM thinks is appropriate to the object.

**Range.** If you throw the weapon, it has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.

If an improvised weapon resembles a weapon on the Weapons table, the DM may say it functions as that weapon and uses that weapon's rules. For example, the DM could treat a table leg as a club.

# ADVENTURING GEAR

Here are some special items (with their prices and weights) that adventurers find useful:

**Candle (1 cp, 0 lb).** For 1 hour, this candle sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet.

**Disguise Kit (25 gp, 3 lb).** This pouch of cosmetics and props lets you create disguises. Proficiency with this kit lets you add your proficiency bonus to any ability checks you make to create a disguise.

**Healer's Kit (5 gp, 3 lb).** This kit is a pouch containing bandages, salves, and splints. It has ten uses. As an action, you can expend one use of the kit to stabilize a creature that has 0 hit points, without needing to make a Wisdom (Medicine) check.

**Holy Water (25 gp, 1 lb).** As an action, you can splash this water onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw it up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. In either case, make a ranged attack against a target creature, treating the holy water as an improvised weapon. If the target is a Fiend or an Undead, it takes 2d6 radiant damage on a hit.

**Lantern, Bullseye (10 gp, 2 lb).** This lantern casts bright light in a 60-foot cone and dim light for an additional 60 feet. It burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil.

**Lock (10 gp, 1 lb).** A key is provided with this lock. A creature proficient with thieves' tools can pick the lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check.

**Oil (1 sp, 1 lb).** This oil comes in a flask that holds 1 pint. As an action, you can splash the oil onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw it up to 20

----

## LIFTING AND CARRYING

Here are the rules for how much a creature can carry.

**Carrying Capacity.** Your carrying capacity is your Strength score multiplied by 15. This is the weight (in pounds) that you can carry, which is high enough that most characters don't usually have to worry about it.

**Push, Drag, or Lift.** You can push, drag, or lift a weight in pounds up to twice your carrying capacity (or 30 times your Strength score). While pushing or dragging weight in excess of your carrying capacity, your speed drops to 5 feet.

**Size and Strength.** Larger creatures can bear more weight, whereas Tiny creatures can carry less. For each size category above Medium, double the creature's carrying capacity and the amount it can push, drag, or lift. For a Tiny creature, halve these weights.

----

feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a target, treating the oil as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target is covered in oil. If the target takes any fire damage before the oil dries (after 1 minute), the target takes an additional 5 fire damage from the burning oil. You can also pour a flask of oil on the ground to cover a 5-foot square area that is level. If lit, the oil burns for 2 rounds and deals 5 fire damage to any creature that enters the area or ends its turn there. A creature can take this damage only once per turn.

**Quiver (1 gp, 1 lb).** This quiver holds up to 20 arrows or bolts.

**Rations (5 sp, 2 lb).** These rations are enough for one person for one day and include jerky, dried fruit, hardtack, and nuts.

**Rope, Hempen (1 gp, 10 lb) or Silk (10 gp, 5 lb).** This rope is 50 feet long, has 2 hit points, and can be burst with a DC 17 Strength check.

**Shield (10 gp, 6 lb).** This shield is made of wood or metal. Equipping it requires an action. While equipped, the shield increases your AC by 2 if you have shield proficiency. You can benefit from only one shield at a time.

**Thieves' Tools (25 gp, 1 lb).** This set of tools includes a small file, lock picks, a small mirror with a metal handle, a set of narrow-bladed scissors, and a pair of pliers. Proficiency with these tools lets you add your proficiency bonus to any ability checks you make to disarm traps or open locks.

**Tinderbox (5 sp, 1 lb).** This container holds flint, fire steel, and tinder used to kindle a fire. Using it to light a torch—or anything else with abundant, exposed fuel—takes an action. Lighting any other fire takes 1 minute.

**Torch (1 cp, 1 lb).** This torch burns for 1 hour, providing bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. If you make a melee attack with a burning torch and hit, it deals 1 fire damage.



CHAPTER 3
# SPELLS

Magic permeates the worlds of D&D and most often appears in the form of a magic spell. This chapter provides the rules for casting spells, which can create many sorts of wonders. The chapter also includes a collection of spells for use by spellcasters, such as the cleric, the wizard, and the paladin.

## GAINING SPELLS

Before a spellcaster can use a spell, they must have the spell firmly fixed in mind or must have access to the spell in a magic item. Members of a few classes (such as the sorcerer in the *Player's Handbook*) have a limited list of spells that are always fixed in mind. The same thing is true of many magic-using monsters. Other spellcasters, such as clerics and wizards, undergo a process of preparing spells. This process varies for different classes, as detailed in the description of their Spellcasting features.

## CASTING A SPELL

Whenever a creature casts a spell, the same basic rules are followed, and the descriptions of all spells are structured alike. Each spell description begins with the spell's name, level, school of magic, casting time, range, components, and duration. The rest of a spell entry describes the spell's effect. The following sections explain each part of a spell description.

### SPELL LEVEL

Every spell has a level from 0 to 9, which is indicated in a spell's description. A spell's level is a general indicator of how powerful it is. Cantrips—simple spells that can be cast almost by rote—are level 0. The rules for each spellcasting class (shown on the character sheet) say when members of that class gain access to spells of certain levels.

### SPELL SLOTS

Spellcasting is taxing, so a spellcaster can cast only a limited number of spells before resting. Spell slots are the main way a spellcaster's magical potential is represented, and each spellcasting class gives its members a limited number of spell slots of certain spell levels. For example, a 3rd-level wizard has four 1st-level spell slots and two 2nd-level slots.

When you cast a spell, you expend a slot of that spell's level or higher, effectively "filling" a slot with the spell. You can think of a spell slot as a groove of a certain size—small for a 1st-level slot, larger for a spell of higher level. A 1st-level spell fits into a slot of any size, but a 2nd-level spell fits only in a slot that's at least 2nd level. So when a 3rd-level wizard casts *magic missile*, a 1st-level spell, that wizard spends one of four 1st-level slots and has three remaining.

Finishing a long rest restores any expended spell slots (see page 17 for the rules on resting).

SPELLCASTING



# CASTING AT A HIGHER LEVEL

When a spellcaster casts a spell using a slot that is of a higher level than the spell, the spell takes on the higher level for that casting. For instance, if a wizard casts *magic missile* using a 2nd-level slot, that *magic missile* is 2nd level. Effectively, the spell expands to fill the slot it is put into.

Some spells, such as *magic missile* and *cure wounds*, have more powerful effects when cast at a higher level, as detailed in a spell's description.

## CASTING WITHOUT SLOTS

There are several ways to cast a spell without expending a spell slot:

**Cantrips.** A spell of 0 level (aka a cantrip) can be cast without a spell slot.

**Rituals.** Certain spells have a special tag: "ritual." Such a spell can be cast following the normal rules for spellcasting, or the spell can be cast as a ritual. The ritual version of a spell takes 10 minutes longer to cast than normal. It also doesn't expend a spell slot. To cast a spell as a ritual, a spellcaster must have a feature that grants the ability to do so. The cleric and wizard, for example, have such a feature. The caster must also have the spell prepared, unless the character's ritual feature specifies otherwise, as the wizard's does.

**Special Abilities.** Some characters and monsters have special abilities that allow them to cast specific spells without a spell slot. This casting is usually limited in another way, such as being able to cast the spell a limited number of times per day.

**Magic Items.** *Spell scrolls* and some other magic items contain spells that can be cast without a spell slot. The description of such an item specifies how many times a spell can be cast from it.

# SCHOOL OF MAGIC

Each spell is part of a magical category, which is called a school of magic. The schools of magic are listed in the Schools of Magic table. These categories help describe spells but have no rules of their own, although some other rules refer to them.

## SCHOOLS OF MAGIC

| School        | Typical Effects                                                  |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Abjuration    | Prevents or negates harmful effects                              |
| Conjuration   | Transports creatures or objects                                  |
| Divination    | Reveals thoughts, places, and times                              |
| Enchantment   | Influences others' minds                                         |
| Evocation     | Channels magical energy to create destructive or healing effects |
| Illusion      | Deceives the mind or senses                                      |
| Necromancy    | Manipulates life and death                                       |
| Transmutation | Transforms creatures or objects                                  |


----

> ## CASTING IN ARMOR
> 
> Because of the mental focus and precise gestures required for spellcasting, you must be proficient with the armor you are wearing to cast a spell (as noted in chapter 2). You are otherwise too distracted and physically hampered by your armor for spellcasting.

# CASTING TIME

Most spells require a single action to cast, but some spells require a bonus action, a reaction, or much more time to cast.

## BONUS ACTION

A spell cast with a bonus action is especially swift. You must use a bonus action on your turn to cast the spell, provided that you haven't already taken a bonus action this turn. You can't cast another spell during the same turn, except for a cantrip with a casting time of 1 action.

## REACTIONS

Some spells can be cast as reactions. These spells take a fraction of a second to bring about and are cast in response to some event. If a spell can be cast as a reaction, the spell description tells you exactly when you can do so.

## LONGER CASTING TIMES

Certain spells (including spells cast as rituals) require more time to cast: minutes or even hours. When you cast a spell with a casting time longer than a single action or reaction, you must spend your action each turn casting the spell, and you must maintain your concentration while you do so (see "Concentration" later in this chapter). If your concentration is broken, the spell fails, but you don't expend a spell slot. If you want to try casting the spell again, you must start over.

# RANGE

A spell's range indicates how far away from the spellcaster the spell's effect can originate, and the spell's description specifies which part of the effect is limited by the range. Once a spell is cast, its effects aren't restricted by its range, unless the spell's description says otherwise.

A range typically takes one of the following forms:

**Distance.** The range is expressed in feet.

**Touch.** The spell's effect originates on something the spellcaster must touch, as defined in the spell.

**Self.** A spell with a range of "Self" can be cast only on the spellcaster.

**Self (Area of Effect).** A spell with a range of "Self" followed by an area of effect in parentheses, such as "Self (15-foot cone)," creates an area of effect that originates from the spellcaster (see "Areas of Effect" later in this chapter).


# COMPONENTS

A spell's components are the physical requirements the spellcaster must meet in order to cast it. Each spell's description indicates whether it requires verbal (V), somatic (S), or material (M) components. If the spellcaster can't provide one or more of a spell's components, the spellcaster can't cast the spell.

## VERBAL (V)

A verbal component is the chanting of mystic words. The words themselves aren't the source of the spell's power; rather, the particular combination of sounds, with specific pitch and resonance, sets the threads of magic in motion. Thus, a creature who is gagged or in an area of magical silence can't cast a spell with a verbal component.

## SOMATIC (S)

Spellcasting gestures might include a forceful gesticulation or an intricate set of gestures. If a spell requires a somatic component, the caster must have free use of at least one hand to perform these gestures.

## MATERIAL (M)

Casting some spells requires particular materials, as specified in parentheses in the Components entry. These materials aren't consumed by the spell, unless the spell's description states otherwise. The spellcaster must have a hand free to access them, but it can be the same hand used to perform somatic components, if any.

Instead of providing the materials specified in a spell, a spellcaster can use a component pouch or a spellcasting focus (both described below) as the material component. This option is available only when a spell doesn't consume its materials and doesn't specify a cost for them.

*Component Pouch (25 gp, 2 lb).* A component pouch is a small, watertight leather belt pouch that has compartments holding all of a spellcaster's free, non-consumable material components. The pouch can be used by any spellcaster.

*Spellcasting Focus.* Some spellcasters have the special ability to use an object called a spellcasting focus as their spells' material component.

The Spellcasting Focuses table lists focuses available to wizards (arcane focuses) as well as clerics and paladins (holy symbols). The table's Usage column indicates whether the spellcaster has to hold or wear a focus to use it.

# SPELLCASTING FOCUSES

| Focus                                 | Usage        | Cost  | Weight |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------ | ----- | ------ |
| *Arcane Focuses (Wizards)*            |              |       |        |
| Crystal                               | Held         | 10 gp | 1 lb   |
| Orb                                   | Held         | 20 gp | 3 lb   |
| Rod                                   | Held         | 10 gp | 2 lb   |
| Staff                                 | Held         | 5 gp  | 4 lb   |
| Wand                                  | Held         | 10 gp | 1 lb   |
| *Holy Symbols (Clerics and Paladins)* |              |       |        |
| Amulet                                | Held or worn | 5 gp  | 1 lb   |
| Emblem                                | Held or worn | 5 gp  | —      |
| Reliquary                             | Held or worn | 5 gp  | 2 lb   |


# DURATION

A spell's duration is the length of time the spell persists after it is cast. A duration typically takes one of the following forms:

**Concentration.** A duration that requires concentration follows the concentration rules below.

**Instantaneous.** A duration of "Instantaneous" means the spell appears only for a moment and can't be dispelled.

**Time Span.** A duration that provides a time span specifies how long the spell lasts in rounds, minutes, hours, or the like. For example, a Duration entry might say "1 minute," meaning the spell ends after 1 minute has passed.

## CONCENTRATION

Some spells require the spellcaster to concentrate to keep the spells' magic active. If the spellcaster loses concentration, such a spell ends. If a spell must be maintained with concentration, that fact appears in its Duration entry, and the spell specifies how long the spellcaster can concentrate on it. The spellcaster can end concentration at any time (no action required).

Normal activity, such as moving and attacking, doesn't interfere with concentration. The following factors can break concentration:

**Casting Another Concentration Spell.** The spellcaster loses concentration on a spell if they start casting another spell that requires concentration.

**Taking Damage.** Whenever a spellcaster takes damage while concentrating on a spell, they must succeed on a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration. The DC equals 10 or half the damage taken (round down), whichever is higher.

**Being Incapacitated or Killed.** A spellcaster loses concentration on a spell if they die or suffer the incapacitated condition (see the appendix).


# AREAS OF EFFECT

Spells such as *thunderwave* cover an area called an area of effect, which uses the special rules here. Some other game features, such as a dragon's breath, also use these rules.

The description of a spell or another feature specifies whether it has an area of effect, which typically has one of five different shapes: cone, cube, cylinder, line, or sphere. Every area of effect has a point of origin, a location from which the effect's energy erupts. The rules for each shape specify how to position its point of origin. Typically, a point of origin is a point in space, but some effects have an area whose origin is a creature or an object.

An effect expands in straight lines from the point of origin. If no unblocked straight line extends from the point of origin to a location within the area of effect, that location isn't included in the area. To block one of these imaginary lines, an obstruction must provide total cover.

## CONE

A cone extends in a direction that its creator chooses from its point of origin. A cone's width at a given point along its length is equal to that point's distance from the point of origin. A cone's area of effect specifies its maximum length.

A cone's point of origin isn't included in the cone's area of effect, unless its creator decides otherwise.

## CUBE

A cube's creator selects its point of origin, which lies anywhere on a face of the cubic effect. The cube's size is expressed as the length of each side.

A cube's point of origin isn't included in the cube's area of effect, unless its creator decides otherwise.

## CYLINDER

A cylinder's point of origin is the center of a circle of a particular radius, as given in the effect's description. The circle must either be on the ground or at the top of the effect. The energy in a cylinder expands in straight lines from the point of origin to the perimeter of the circle, forming the base of the cylinder. The effect then shoots up from the base or down from the top, to a distance equal to the height of the cylinder.

A cylinder's point of origin is included in the cylinder's area of effect.

## LINE

A line extends from its point of origin in a straight path up to its length and covers an area defined by its width.

A line's point of origin isn't included in the line's area of effect, unless its creator decides otherwise.

## SPHERE

A sphere's creator selects its point of origin, and the sphere extends outward from that point. The sphere's size is expressed as a radius that extends from the point.

A sphere's point of origin is included in the sphere's area of effect.


# TARGETS

A typical spell requires the caster to pick one or more targets to be affected by the spell's magic. A spell's description says whether the spell targets creatures, objects, a point of origin for an area of effect, or something else.

Unless a spell has a perceptible effect, a creature might not know it was targeted by the spell. An effect like lightning is obvious, but a more subtle effect, such as an attempt to read thoughts, typically goes unnoticed, unless a spell says otherwise.

## A CLEAR PATH TO THE TARGET

To target something with a spell, a caster must have a clear path to it, so it can't be behind total cover.

If a spellcaster places an area of effect at an unseen point and an obstruction, such as a wall, is between the caster and that point, the point of origin comes into being on the near side of that obstruction.

## TARGETING YOURSELF

If a spell targets a creature of your choice, you can choose yourself, unless the creature must be hostile or specifically a creature other than you. If you are in the area of effect of a spell you cast, you can target yourself.

## SAVING THROWS

Many spells specify that a target must make a saving throw to avoid some or all of a spell's effects. The spell specifies the ability that the target uses for the save and what happens on a success or failure.

**Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your spellcasting ability modifier**

## ATTACK ROLLS

Some spells require the caster to make an attack roll to determine whether the spell hits a target.

**Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your spellcasting ability modifier**

# COMBINING SPELLS

The effects of different spells add together while their durations overlap. In contrast, the effects of the same spell cast multiple times don't combine. Instead, the most potent effect—such as the highest bonus—from those castings applies while their durations overlap. Or the most recent effect applies if the castings are equally potent and their durations overlap. For example, if two clerics cast *bless* on the same target, that character gains the spell's benefit only once; the target doesn't receive two bonus dice.

# SPELL DESCRIPTIONS

The spells are presented in alphabetical order. A spell's caster is the "you" addressed in the spell's description.

## BLESS

*1st-Level Enchantment*

**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Range:** 30 feet
**Components:** V, S, M (a sprinkling of holy water)
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You bless up to three creatures of your choice within range. Whenever a target makes an attack roll or a saving throw before the spell ends, the target can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to the attack roll or saving throw.

*At Higher Levels.* When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 1st.

## COMMAND

*1st-Level Enchantment*

**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Range:** 60 feet
**Components:** V
**Duration:** 1 round

You speak a one-word command to a creature you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or follow the command on its next turn. The spell has no effect if the target is Undead, if it doesn't understand your language, or if your command is directly harmful to it.

Some typical commands and their effects follow. You might issue a command other than one described here. If you do so, the DM determines how the target behaves. If the target can't follow your command, the spell ends.

*Approach.* The target moves toward you by the shortest and most direct route, ending its turn if it moves within 5 feet of you.

*Drop.* The target drops whatever it is holding and then ends its turn.

*Flee.* The target spends its turn moving away from you by the fastest available means.

*Grovel.* The target falls prone and then ends its turn.

*Halt.* The target doesn't move and takes no actions. A flying creature stays aloft, provided that it is able to do so. If it must move to stay aloft, it flies the minimum distance needed to remain in the air.

*At Higher Levels.* When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can affect one additional creature for each slot level above 1st. The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.


# COMPREHEND LANGUAGES
*1st-Level Divination (Ritual)*

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of soot and salt)  
**Duration:** 1 hour

For the duration, you understand the literal meaning of any spoken language that you hear. You also understand any written language that you see, but you must be touching the surface on which the words are written. It takes about 1 minute to read one page of text.

This spell doesn't decode secret messages in a text or a glyph, such as an arcane sigil, that isn't part of a written language.

# CURE WOUNDS
*1st-Level Evocation*

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Touch  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

A creature you touch regains a number of hit points equal to 1d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier. This spell has no effect on Undead or Constructs.

*At Higher Levels.* When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the healing increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.

# DETECT MAGIC
*1st-Level Divination (Ritual)*

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

For the duration, you sense the presence of magic within 30 feet of you. If you sense magic in this way, you can use your action to see a faint aura around any visible creature or object in the area that bears magic, and you learn its school of magic, if any.

The spell can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.

# FLAMING SPHERE
*2nd-Level Conjuration*

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 60 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (a bit of tallow, a pinch of brimstone, and a dusting of powdered iron)  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

A 5-foot-diameter sphere of fire appears in an unoccupied space of your choice within range and lasts for the duration. Any creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of the sphere must make a Dexterity saving throw. The creature takes 2d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one (round down).

As a bonus action, you can move the sphere up to 30 feet. If you ram the sphere into a creature, that creature must make the save against the sphere's damage, and the sphere stops moving this turn.

When you move the sphere, you can direct it over barriers up to 5 feet tall and jump it across pits up to 10 feet wide. The sphere ignites flammable objects not being worn or carried, and it sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet.

*At Higher Levels.* When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 2nd.


# GUIDING BOLT
*1st-Level Evocation*

**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Range:** 120 feet

# MAGE HAND
*Conjuration Cantrip*

**Casting Time:** 1 action

*1st-Level Abjuration*

**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Range:** Touch

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch is protected against certain types of creatures: Aberrations, Celestials, Elementals, Fey, Fiends, and Undead.

The protection grants several benefits. Creatures of those types have disadvantage on attack rolls against the target. The target also can't be charmed, frightened, or possessed by them. If the target is already charmed, frightened, or possessed by such a creature, the target has advantage on any new saving throw against the relevant effect.

You ward a creature within range against attack. Until the spell ends, any creature who targets the warded creature with an attack or a harmful spell must first make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature must choose a new target or lose the attack or spell. This spell doesn't protect the warded creature from area effects, such as the explosion of a fireball.

If the warded creature makes an attack, casts a spell that affects an enemy, or deals damage to another creature, this spell ends.

A creature takes 3d8 thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature made of inorganic material such as stone, crystal, or metal has disadvantage on the saving throw.

A nonmagical object that isn't being worn or carried also takes the damage if it's in the spell's area.

*At Higher Levels.* When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.

**Range:** 90 feet
**Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of fine sand, rose petals, or a cricket)
**Duration:** 1 minute

This spell sends creatures into a magical slumber. Roll 5d8; the total is how many hit points of creatures this spell can affect. Creatures within 20 feet of a point you choose within range are affected in ascending order of their current hit points (ignoring unconscious creatures).

Starting with the creature that has the lowest current hit points, each creature affected by this spell falls unconscious until the spell ends, the sleeper takes damage, or someone uses an action to shake or slap the sleeper awake. Subtract each creature's hit points from the total before moving on to the creature with the next lowest hit points. A creature's hit points must be equal to or less than the remaining total for that creature to be affected.

Undead and creatures immune to being charmed aren't affected by this spell.

*At Higher Levels.* When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, roll an additional 2d8 for each slot level above 1st.

# SPIRITUAL WEAPON

As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the weapon up to 20 feet and repeat the attack against a creature within 5 feet of it.

The weapon can take whatever form you choose. Clerics of deities who are associated with a particular weapon (as St. Cuthbert is known for his mace and Thor for his hammer) make this spell's effect resemble that weapon.

*At Higher Levels.* When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.

RUNNING THE ADVENTURE

THIS BOOKLET IS FOR THE DUNGEON MASTER. It contains a complete DUNGEONS & DRAGONS adventure, as well as descriptions for the magic items and creatures in the adventure. It also teaches you how to run a D&D game.

The rulebook that accompanies this booklet contains the rules for handling the situations that arise during the adventure.

# OVERVIEW

A D&D adventure is a collection of locations, quests, and challenges that inspire you to tell a story. The outcome of that story is determined by the actions and decisions of the adventurers—and the luck of the dice.

*Dragons of Stormwreck Isle* draws the characters into the midst of an ancient war among dragons as they explore an island that has long been a battlefield in that conflict. Here's an overview of what you'll find in this booklet:

**Running the Adventure.** The booklet starts with an overview of the adventure. Then it takes a look at the role of the Dungeon Master in a game of D&D, and some tips to help you in this role.

**Adventure Sites.** The four chapters of the adventure describe locations on Stormwreck Isle where characters can explore, interact with various creatures, and pursue their goals. The first site, Dragon's Rest, serves as the characters' home base during the adventure, where they can rest and get supplies between their visits to the other sites.

**Magic Items and Monsters.** Two appendixes describe rules for magic items and monsters that characters might find in the course of the adventure.

# GETTING STARTED

To get started, have each player choose one character to play. Five characters printed on separate sheets are included in the box. Tell the players to read over the character sheets; give their characters names; and invent the details of their characters' personality and appearance. Encourage the players to write on the character sheets to make these characters their own.

# THE FORGOTTEN REALMS

The Forgotten Realms is a world of high fantasy, populated by elves, dwarves, halflings, humans, and other folk—one of many such worlds in the vast multiverse of the D&D game. In the Realms, fighters dare the crypts of the fallen dwarf kings of Delzoun, seeking glory and treasure. Rogues prowl the dark alleyways of teeming cities such as Neverwinter and Baldur's Gate. Clerics in the service of gods wield mace and spell, defending against the terrifying powers that threaten the land. Wizards plunder the ruins of the fallen Netherese empire, delving into secrets too sinister for the light of day.

The roads and rivers of the Realms carry minstrels and peddlers, merchants and guards, soldiers and sailors. Bold adventurers follow tales of strange, glorious, faraway places. Good maps and clear trails can take even an inexperienced youth with dreams of glory far across the world, but these paths are never safe. Travelers in the Realms face fell magic and deadly monsters. Even farms and freeholds a day's walk from a city can fall prey to monsters, and no place is safe from the wrath of a dragon.

This adventure takes place on Stormwreck Isle, a small island in a region called the Sword Coast. This region is a place of adventure, where daring souls delve into ancient strongholds and explore the ruins of long-lost kingdoms. Amid a lawless wilderness of jagged, snow-capped peaks, alpine forests, bitter winds, and roaming monsters, the coast holds renowned bastions of civilization such as the city of Neverwinter, in the shadow of the fuming volcano known as Mount Hotenow.

> **NUMBER OF PLAYERS**
>
> You can run *Dragons of Stormwreck Isle* for one to five players. If you have four or five friends ready to play with you, each person can take one of the characters provided in the box. Five players will find the encounters a little easier than four players will, but the adventure works fine as written for groups of four or five players.
>
> If you have fewer than four players, you can have some players take on the role of two characters so the group has at least four characters. A player with two characters should treat one of them as their main character and the other as a sidekick, there to help out but probably not engaging in a lot of dialogue.


# ADVENTURE BACKGROUND

According to legend, two families of dragons came into being in the very first days of the world's creation. Bahamut, the noble Platinum Dragon, made the metallic dragons—gold, silver, bronze, brass, and copper. Cruel, five-headed Tiamat made the chromatic dragons—red, blue, green, black and white. The metallic and chromatic dragons share a mutual animosity that originates in the enmity between Bahamut and Tiamat.

The origin of Dragon's Rest is rooted in that animosity. Ages ago, a fire-breathing red dragon called Sharruth rampaged up and down the Sword Coast. Three metallic dragons joined forces to battle Sharruth and imprisoned her beneath the ocean floor, believing seawater would quench her fire and keep her bound forever. But Sharruth's fury, legend says, caused the undersea volcanic activity that formed Stormwreck Isle.

In all likelihood, Sharruth is long dead and entombed beneath the island, but chromatic dragons whisper that she still lives and will one day emerge from her prison. One fact is undeniable: the powerful magic embodied in such an ancient dragon has left a permanent mark on Stormwreck Isle. That magic has drawn other dragons to the island throughout the centuries, making it a recurring battlefield in the conflict between chromatic and metallic dragons. Several of these dragons have died there, each leaving behind a spiritual scar that causes unpredictable magical effects.

A hundred years ago, a blue dragon tried to harness this destructive magic. A bronze dragon named Runara pleaded with him to abandon his schemes. When he refused, Runara killed him, adding one more dragon grave to the island.

Runara has grown weary of strife, and Stormwreck Isle's wounds are a constant reminder to her of the cost of such conflict. Devoting herself to peace and reconciliation, she established the cloister of Dragon's Rest as a safe haven from violence. Living in human guise, Runara now serves as the leader of a tiny group of hermits and ascetics.

But the ageless conflict between chromatic and metallic dragons threatens to disrupt the serenity of Dragon's Rest—and this is where the adventure begins!

# ADVENTURE OUTLINE

In *Dragons of Stormwreck Isle*, the characters experience the magical scars left behind by the death of dragons. Faced with the evil schemes of one living dragon and the righteous anger of another, they'll have the chance to explore whether peace between the feuding dragon families is possible—or if they must resort to violence to resolve the conflict on this isle.

This adventure has four chapters:

**Chapter 1**, "Dragon's Rest," introduces Runara's cloister and its inhabitants and provides the characters the opportunity to learn about the problems facing the island. It also describes additional encounters you can use in the course of the adventure, including a magical hot spring with mysterious guardians at the site of a brass dragon's death.

**Chapter 2**, "Seagrow Caves," describes how the grave of Sharruth spawns magical connections to the Elemental Plane of Fire that threaten a community of octopus-like mushroom-like myconids.

**Chapter 3**, "Cursed Shipwreck," details a ship that crashed alongside the bones of a gold dragon and the horrible curse within the ship's hold.

**Chapter 4**, "Clifftop Observatory," brings the characters to the site where Runara killed a blue dragon—and where that blue dragon's grandson has made his lair. There they'll also find a bronze wyrmling who rejected Runara's teachings of peace, now held prisoner in the blue dragon's lair.

# ADVENTURE MAPS

The maps in this booklet are for the DM's eyes only. These maps show secret doors and other elements the players aren't meant to see.

When the characters arrive at a location marked on a map, describe it to give them a clear mental picture of the location. You can also draw what they see on paper, copying what's on your map while omitting secret details. It's not important that your hand-drawn map perfectly match what's in the printed adventure. Try to get the basic shape and dimensions correct and leave the rest to the players' imaginations.


# THE DUNGEON MASTER

The Dungeon Master has a special role in D&D games.

The DM is a **storyteller**. The DM presents the challenges and encounters that the characters must overcome. The DM is the players' interface to the D&D world, who reads (and sometimes also writes) the adventure and describes what happens in response to the characters' actions.

The DM is a **referee**. When it's not clear what ought to happen next, the DM decides how to apply the rules and keep the story going.

The DM is a **roleplayer**. The DM plays the monsters in the adventure, choosing their actions and rolling dice for their attacks. The DM also plays all the other people the characters meet, including helpful ones.

## DM TIPS

The most important part of being a good DM is facilitating the fun of everyone at the table. Keep these tips in mind to help things go smoothly:

**Embrace the shared story.** D&D is about telling a story as a group, so let the players contribute to the outcome through the words and deeds of their characters. If some players are reluctant to speak up, ask them what their characters are doing.

**It's not a competition.** The DM isn't competing against the player characters. Your job is to referee the rules, run monsters, and keep the story moving.

**Be fair and flexible.** Treat your players in a fair, impartial manner. The rules help you do this, but you can make your own rulings to ensure everyone is having fun.

**Modify the adventure to suit your tastes.** The adventure has no prescribed outcome. You can alter any encounter to make it more interesting and fun for your players.

**Keep a notepad handy.** Use it to track details such as the characters' and monsters' initiative order.

## SHARING INFORMATION

As Dungeon Master, one of your most important tasks is figuring out how much to tell the players and when. All the information the players need to make choices comes from you. Within the rules of the game and the limits of the characters' knowledge and senses, tell players everything they need to know.

> Text that appears in a box like this is meant to be read aloud or paraphrased to the players when their characters first arrive at a location or under a specific circumstance, as described in the text. It usually describes locations or presents scripted dialogue, so the players know what's up and have a sense of what their characters' options are.

You don't have to reveal every aspect of a situation or hazard in one go. Boxed text typically describes everything the characters see, hear, or smell at first glance. As characters search rooms, make Wisdom (Perception) or Intelligence (Investigation) checks, open drawers and chests, and generally examine things more closely, give players more details about what their characters find.

*Creature Stat Blocks.* Whenever the adventure text presents a creature's name in **bold** type, that's a visual cue directing you to the creature's stat block in appendix B. Those stat blocks are intended for your eyes only. However, as the characters fight monsters, you can reveal certain information to help them make smart choices in combat:

**Hit Points.** You can give players a sense of how well they're doing against a creature by describing, in narrative terms, how hurt the creature is. For example, if the creature has fewer than half its hit points remaining, you can describe it as being badly wounded. Such information gives the players a sense of progress and might spur them to press the attack. On the other hand, if the characters aren't damaging the creature much, let the players know that the creature looks like it can take a lot more punishment. That might encourage the players to change their plan.

**Abilities, Strengths, and Weaknesses.** As they fight a creature, characters should learn more about the creature's abilities. Share information with the players as it becomes apparent. For example, if the wizard casts *flaming sphere* (a spell that deals fire damage) against a fire snake (a creature that's immune to fire damage), let the wizard's player know the spell doesn't seem to bother the creature at all. Players might correctly guess that a fire snake probably isn't harmed by fire; feel free to subtly confirm their guesses (perhaps smiling and saying, "That sounds reasonable").

*Story Information.* A location description might include important information not in boxed text. Often you're meant to reveal such information when the characters examine particular areas or interact with creatures.



MAP 1: STORMWRECK ISLE

# STORMWRECK ISLE

[Map showing Stormwreck Isle with compass rose in top left, showing locations including: The Wreck of Compass Rose, Dragon's Rest, Seagrow Caves, Clifftop Observatory, and Treeholt Road. The map uses a hex grid overlay with scale indicator "1 Hex = 1/2 Mile"]

As the DM, you roleplay the creatures that the characters encounter. The adventure offers guidance to help you decide what these creatures know and how willing they are to share information with the characters. Beyond that, improvise and bring these creatures to life as best you can. For example, the adventure describes Runara (the disguised bronze dragon who leads the cloister of Dragon's Rest) as wise and peace-loving, but you get to decide what her voice sounds like and how she reacts to a given situation. You can also ignore what the text says and roleplay Runara or any other creature as you see fit.

**Treasure.** When characters find treasure, tell them how many coins they find and how much any gems and art objects are worth. Sometimes treasure includes magic items, whose names are presented in *italic* type. Appendix A describes these items and their properties, as well as the rules for how characters figure out what a magic item does.

## MAKING MISTAKES

Dungeon Masters are fallible, just like everyone else, and even experienced DMs make mistakes. If you overlook, forget, or misrepresent something, correct yourself and move on. No one expects you to memorize every part of this adventure and all the rules in the rulebook. As long as your players are having fun, everything will be just fine.

## IMPROVISING ABILITY CHECKS

The adventure often tells you what ability checks characters might try in certain situations and the Difficulty Class (DC) of those checks. But sometimes characters try things that the adventure can't anticipate. In that case, you decide how to handle it.

Ability checks are for situations where a character's success or failure isn't guaranteed. If anyone can easily accomplish a task, don't ask for an ability check. Just tell the player what happens. And if there's no way anyone could accomplish the task, just tell the player it doesn't work.

When you decide an ability check is required, consult the "Ability Checks" section of the rulebook and the table of Typical Difficulty Classes. Most of the time, choose a DC that is easy (DC 10), moderate (DC 15), or hard (DC 20).

# CHAPTER 1
# DRAGON'S REST

THE ADVENTURE BEGINS AT A TINY CLOISTER CALLED Dragon's Rest, a haven where world-weary people come to seek peace, reconciliation, and enlightenment. There, the characters learn about the dangers facing Stormwreck Isle.

Each character has a specific reason for coming to the cloister, as shown on the character sheets. You can also let players invent their own reasons for their characters to seek out Runara's wisdom and assistance.

## WELCOME TO DRAGON'S REST

Read the following text when you're ready to start:

> Your journey was uneventful, but the island now visible off the bow promises rare wonders. Seaweed shimmers in countless brilliant colors below you, and rays of sunlight defy the overcast sky to illuminate the lush grass and dark basalt rock of the island. Avoiding the rocks jutting up from the ocean, your ship makes its way toward a calm harbor on the island's north side.

A large, open-air temple comes into view, perched on the edge of a cliff high above you. The ship drops anchor at the mouth of the harbor, and two sailors row you ashore. You have plenty of time to admire the towering statue at the center of the temple: a bronze, a wizened man surrounded by seven songbirds. A long path winds up the side of the cliff to the temple, dotted along the way with doorways cut into the rock.

The sailors set you ashore on a rickety dock, where a large rowboat is neatly tied. They point to the base of the path and wish you good luck before they row back to the ship. Your visit to Dragon's Rest begins!

Before continuing with the adventure, encourage the players to introduce their characters to each other if they haven't done so already. They might want to discuss their reasons for visiting Dragon's Rest, or they might prefer to keep their reasons secret for now. If they have any questions about what they can see of the cloister from the boat, use map


2 (on page 11) and the information in "Dragon's Rest Locations" to answer them.

Ask the players to give you the party's marching order as they start toward the cloister. Who's in front, and who's bringing up the rear? Make a note of this marching order.

When you're ready, continue with the "Drowned Sailors" section.

## DROWNED SAILORS

Read the following text to start the encounter:

> As you're about to leave the beach and start your climb, you hear a ruckus of splashing and a wet, gurgling moan behind you. Three figures are shambling up from the water's edge, about thirty feet away. They're dressed as sailors, but their skin is gray and they look drowned. Sea water drools from their slack mouths as they lurch toward you.

The three shambling sailors are **zombies**, the animated corpses of sailors who died in a recent shipwreck. The characters face a choice: they can turn and fight the zombies, or they can continue up the path and leave the slow, shambling zombies behind.

If the characters turn and fight, this is the first combat encounter in the adventure. Here are the steps you should follow to run it:

1. Review the zombie stat block in appendix B.
2. Use the initiative rules in the rulebook to determine who acts first, second, third, and so on. Keep track of everyone's initiative count on your notepad.
3. On the zombies' initiative count, they move toward the characters. If they get close enough, they make melee attacks. The zombies' stat block contains the information you need to resolve these attacks. If all the characters are more than 20 feet away, the zombies use the Dash action so they can move farther. For more information on what the zombies can do on their turn, see "Combat" in the rulebook.
4. The zombies fight until they're all defeated.

*Tip: Undead Fortitude.* The zombies' Undead Fortitude trait reflects how hard it is to kill these walking corpses. When this trait prevents a zombie from dying, give the players a hint about what happened. You might say, "That should have finished

the creature off, but it refuses to stop moving!" On the flip side, any time a zombie takes radiant damage (such as from the cleric's *sacred flame* cantrip), you might describe the creature howling in agony. This can help the players realize that radiant damage is a way to get around Undead Fortitude. If the players ask whether their characters know anything about fighting zombies, have them make DC 10 Intelligence checks. Those who succeed might recall that a particularly powerful blow (a critical hit) or radiant damage can help finish off a zombie.

*Runara's Aid.* In the unlikely event that the zombies defeat the adventurers, Runara comes to their rescue. The characters wake up in the temple (area A5 in Dragon's Rest). Runara explains that she heard the sounds of combat and arrived just in time to prevent the zombies from dragging the characters into the sea.

*Avoiding the Zombies.* If the characters decide not to fight the zombies, they easily escape from the slow, shambling monsters. The zombies don't follow them up the path toward Dragon's Rest. The characters will have another opportunity to deal with the zombies later (see "Cloister Quests" later in this chapter).

## MEETING THE INHABITANTS

Read this text when the characters first climb the path to Dragon's Rest:

> Your arrival quickly draws the attention of the entire population of the place—which consists mostly of kobolds. These small, reptilian folk eye you curiously while a couple of humans watch from a distance. All the cloister's residents are dressed in simple clothes, and no one carries a visible weapon. One of the kobolds pipes up with, "What's your name?"
>
> At that, all the kobolds begin barraging you with questions—"Where are you from?" "What's that?" "Why are you here?" and more that are lost in the din.

Visitors to the cloister are rare, and the kobolds' curiosity is insatiable; they keep asking questions until the characters insist they stop.

When the characters quiet the kobolds (or if the players start showing signs of exasperation), the leader of the cloister approaches to welcome the characters. Read the following text:


> The chattering kobolds fall silent as a new figure comes into view, descending gracefully from the upper part of the cloister. She's an elderly human woman with weathered brown skin, white hair in tight braids, and kindly hazel eyes, dressed in a simple white robe. She smiles as she draws near and extends her arms in greeting.
> 
> "Welcome to Dragon's Rest," she says. "May Bahamut's guidance lead you to whatever you seek."

This is Elder Runara, the leader of Dragon's Rest. If the characters defeated the zombies at the beach, she thanks them for their service to the cloister. Even if they did not fight the zombies, she tells them they're welcome to stay at Dragon's Rest as long as they wish, sleeping either in one of the monastic cells (area A1) or in the temple (area A5) and eating with the rest of the community in the dining room (area A3). Runara says nothing about payment of any kind. If the characters offer to give money or perform services around the cloister in exchange for her hospitality, she accepts these gifts.

Throughout this adventure, Dragon's Rest serves as a home base for the characters. All the places they'll explore on the island are within a few miles of the cloister, and they can return here whenever they wish to rest, heal, and get information they need for the next part of their adventures. In addition, they can buy any of the equipment described in the rulebook from Myla (see "Kobolds").

During their time at Dragon's Rest, the characters can interact with any of its residents. All the residents but Runara live in the small monastic cells cut into the cliff face (area A1 on the cloister map).

## ELDER RUNARA

Elder Runara is the leader of Dragon's Rest. She appears as a human woman, but she is actually an adult bronze dragon disguised in human form. She guides the residents of the cloister in their contemplation and study. The cloister's inhabitants know Runara's true identity, but they do not speak of it to visitors.

Runara's initial attitude toward the characters is indifferent (see "Social Interaction" in the rulebook). She becomes friendly as soon as the characters demonstrate that they care about the cloister's safety, such as by fighting the zombies at the beach or undertaking any of the quests she offers them (see "Cloister Quests" later in this chapter). If the characters harm any of the residents of Dragon's Rest, she becomes hostile and insists the characters make amends for the harm they did before she is willing to deal with them in any way.

Runara's mission is to help those whose lives have been shaped by violence find new paths forward in peace. Ultimately, she would like to see chromatic and metallic dragons find a peaceful way to coexist in the world. In the meantime, she finds comfort in helping humans and other people escape from cycles of violence.

Runara maintains a secret lair in a cave accessed by an undersea tunnel, a short distance from the cloister and not shown on the map of Dragon's Rest. She is careful not to enter or leave the cave when anyone might spot her, and she enters and emerges from the water in the open ocean, out of sight of the cloister. The other residents of the cloister think she lives in the temple at the top of the island (area A5), or they simply laugh away queries about her accommodations, explaining that she's always in the temple, or in the library, or checking on the rest of the residents—she never seems to sleep!

## KOBOLDS

Kobolds are small reptilian Humanoids who believe they are descended from dragons and gravitate to the service of dragons. Over the centuries, many bands of kobolds have been drawn to Stormwreck Isle by the lingering draconic magic that suffuses the island. Nine kobolds utterly devoted to Runara now live at Dragon's Rest.

The **kobolds** of Dragon's Rest are lawful good, sharing Runara's ideals of justice and compassion. Since they are sensitive to sunlight, they work at night and avoid moving about during the day. Unless otherwise noted, the kobolds are initially friendly toward the adventurers.

The kobolds are summarized below. They can provide comic relief, offer a down-to-earth perspective, or be a way for you to pass hints to the players if they're having trouble putting things together. But don't feel like you need to bring all nine of these kobolds to life! Pick one or two of these kobolds that you and the characters like the most and let them be the focus of the characters' interactions with the kobolds:

**Agga** speaks little and has no patience for nonsense. She keeps the rest of the kobolds organized and in line. She is indifferent toward visitors, but if the characters show respect for the cloister and help keep the more rambunctious kobolds in line, her attitude improves to friendly.

**Blepp** has a sharp danger sense and is convinced he's supernaturally lucky. His prized possession is an ordinary dagger he claims is magical.

**Frub** has limitless energy and desperately needs help finding productive directions to channel it. He loves to ask questions about everything other people are doing.



CHRISTOPHER PERKINS

[Image shows a dragon-like humanoid character with horns, wearing robes and holding a staff, with flames in the background]

*Ever since an unfortunate incident in the kitchens, no one is longer allowed to handle Myla's alchemical fire.*

**Kilnip** has terrible insomnia and sleeps only a few hours each day. She is always tired but an eager conversationalist.

**Laylee** has a curious mind and a talent for tools and building. She serves as Myla's helper.

**Mumpo** is so audaciously courageous that he stole a copper piece from Runara's hoard. He's convinced she has no idea. (He is wrong, but Runara finds the situation amusing and lets Mumpo continue to believe in her ignorance.)

**Myla** (lawful good **kobold tinkerer**) is a winged kobold whose brothers, Mek and Minn, now follow Sparkrender, the blue wyrmling in Clifftop Observatory (see chapter 4). When Myla's wings were badly injured in an attack by stirges (which she describes as "hungry, icky, blood-sucking, bat-things"), Runara helped in her recovery. Now Myla spends her time experimenting with alchemy, engineering, and magic.

**Rix** is pious and tends to the temple, acting as Runara's assistant. She adores puns. Rix recently witnessed a ship crashing on the rocks to the north (see "Cloister Quests" later in this chapter).

**Zark** is rude and fond of colorful insults. His favorites are "Eat my sword, bugbear breath!" and "Your father was a gas spore!" He is indifferent toward visitors.

# TARAK

**Tarak** is a human man in late middle age. He has pale skin tanned darker with many freckles, auburn hair and a beard that is mostly gray, and gray-blue eyes. Faded tattoos in an abstract design peek up the side of his neck from beneath his dirt-stained robes.

An avid botanist, Tarak tends the cloister's garden plots, growing flowers, herbs, and vegetables. He is soft spoken and helpful, eager to share his knowledge of herbalism. But his kindly demeanor belies his past as a ruthless poisoner for a thieves' guild. After his work led to the death of his lover, he fled the guild and plans to spend the rest of his life atoning for his past evils.

Tarak is initially friendly toward visitors, but if a character pries into his past, his attitude shifts—first to indifferent, then to hostile if the character continues to push. When he's hostile, his demeanor becomes cold and clipped, and he avoids the characters if he can.

A gold hangman's noose is worked into the design of Tarak's visible tattoos. A character who studies the tattoos and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (History) check recognizes the mark as a symbol associated with the Gilded Gallows, a thieves' guild that operates in a country far to the southeast called Elturgard. A character with the criminal background automatically succeeds on this check. Tarak does not willingly discuss the details of his past with anyone but trusted friends.

Tarak frequently visits the sea caves on the south side of the island to acquire heart cap mushrooms from the myconids that live there. He uses the mushrooms to make *potions of healing*. But the myconids have installed a fearsome guardian at their caves—a fungus-covered octopus monster—that has turned him away on his latest visits, and he is worried (see "Cloister Quests").

# VARNOTH

**Varnoth** is a human woman whose frame, once tightly muscled, has thinned with age. Her black hair is cropped close to her scalp, and her light brown skin bears many scars—one of which runs across her left eye, which is milky and blind. An elegant prosthetic made from wood and metal replaces her right leg below the knee.

Varnoth was a feared general at the head of a mercenary company called the Azure Wolves. Age and battle have taken a toll on her, and she is spending her twilight years in reflective contemplation at Dragon's Rest. Her demeanor is gruff, but she is observant and empathetic. Above all, Varnoth believes in second chances and redemption.

Varnoth has a set of mason's tools that she uses to maintain the temple and other areas of the cloister.


While working in the temple recently, she witnessed a ship change course and crash into the rocks to the north (see "Cloister Quests").

Varnoth is indifferent to visitors, but a character can shift her attitude to Friendly by engaging her in conversation on her favorite topics: history, ethics, and the impact of individual actions on the world.

A character who learns Varnoth's name and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (History) check recalls hearing of General Varnoth Wender and the Azure Wolves, which was a mighty force in the east about a decade ago. A character with the soldier background succeeds on this check automatically.

# DRAGON'S REST LOCATIONS

The following locations are keyed to map 2, which shows the layout of Dragon's Rest.

## A1: PATH AND MONASTIC CELLS

> A long path leads from the rocky shore up the side of the cliff, with occasional stairs to ease the ascent. Here and there along the lower part of the path, well-tended garden plots hold flowers, herbs, and vegetables.
>
> About thirty feet above the bay, the path widens into a long plaza. Halfway along the plaza, a stone statue of a dragon gazes serenely down the path. Six open doorways are cut into the cliff side.

**Statue.** The star-in-a-circle symbol on the map represents the dragon statue. A character who examines the statue and succeeds on a DC 10 Intelligence (Arcana) check recognizes that it depicts a bronze dragon—a member of the metallic family. If characters ask Runara about the statue, she tells them it depicts Astalagan, who died on these cliffs centuries ago. She doesn't tell them that Astalagan was her father.

**Cells.** The doorways lead into simple monastic cells occupied by the cloister residents. Each cell is furnished with a bed, a nightstand, a small desk, and a chair.

The westernmost cell is vacant, and it is available to the characters if they don't mind sharing the space. Next to it is Tarak's cell, then Varnoth's. The fourth cell is Myla's, cluttered with junk and tools. The fifth and sixth cells are strung with hammocks, offering space for the other eight kobolds to sleep.

## A2: WINCH HOUSE

> A small, free-standing building half way up the path has a peaked roof and a weathered wooden door. A sturdy wooden pallet wrapped with rope hangs beneath the building on an iron chain, lying flat against the cliff face.

Inside the building is a winch that allows the pallet to be lowered down to the water, 50 feet below. When boats deliver supplies to the cloister, the residents use this pallet to haul goods both up and down.

A lever locks the winch in place. If a character pulls the lever, the pallet falls down to the water and floats there. As an action, a character can operate the winch to pull the pallet back up 10 feet.

## A3: KITCHEN

> A doorway in the rock opens into a dining room with a long table. Two benches run the length of the table, and a single chair sits at the table's head. A short hallway connects to a small, tidy kitchen.

The cloister residents share three daily meals here. They take turns cooking and cleaning up after meals. Nobody says it out loud, but the days when Tarak cooks are everyone's favorite.

## A4: LIBRARY

> Of all the doorways cut into the cliff face, only one has an actual door. This entry's door is made of sturdy oak with iron bands, and it swings open easily to reveal a spacious library. Bookshelves line every wall, with three free-standing shelves in the west half of the room. In the east half is a table with two benches, writing implements, book stands, and glass-shielded lamps.

The cloister library holds books and scrolls covering a variety of topics, but focused on theology and history. Runara spends nearly half her time in here, studying, copying, and annotating the library's collection. Tarak and Varnoth also come here to read and discuss various works. Many of the kobolds visit as well, but mostly for the quiet; only Myla could be described as studious.



MAP 2: DRAGON'S REST

# DRAGON'S REST

[Map showing a clifftop location with various labeled areas A1-A5, including a temple structure, buildings, and cliff edges. The map includes elevation markers (+90 ft., +80 ft., +60 ft., +50 ft., +30 ft.) and a compass rose. Scale: 1 Square = 5 Feet]

## A5: TEMPLE OF BAHAMUT

> The highest point of the cloister is crowned by an open-air temple that overhangs the cliff, supported by arched stone struts anchored to the cliff face. The north wall of the temple is carved directly into the rock, while the rest is open to the sea air. Heavy pillars mark the three open sides, supporting the wooden roof. In the center of the temple stands a stone statue of a kind-looking old man with canaries perched on his hands, shoulders, and head. A feeling of serenity suffuses the place.

The temple is very simple, with the statue (represented by the star-in-a-circle symbol on the map) as its only furnishing. The statue depicts Bahamut, the Platinum Dragon, in mortal disguise, surrounded by seven canaries that represent gold dragons who accompany him on his travels. A character who examines the statue and succeeds on a DC 10 Intelligence (Religion) check recognizes Bahamut, and any resident of Dragon's Rest identifies the god if asked.

Depressions in the statue's pedestal at the four cardinal directions hold offerings of incense made to Bahamut. Runara spends about half her time here, tending and maintaining the temple, offering prayers and incense, or in quiet contemplation. Other residents of the cloister help her, most often Varnoth and the kobold Rix.

The feeling of serenity that pervades the temple is the result of protective magic. A non-evil creature who makes a saving throw within the temple can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to the saving throw. If a character casts *detect magic* in the temple, the spell reveals a faint aura around the statue. Runara is the only inhabitant of Dragon's Rest who knows that this is a lingering effect of the death of a dragon on this site—her father, Astalagan.

**About Bahamut.** Known as the Platinum Dragon, Bahamut is the patron and progenitor of metallic dragons. Adventurers and dragons alike pray to Bahamut to uphold honor and justice, or when they need courage to face a great threat. He seldom interferes in the affairs of mortal creatures, though he makes exceptions to help thwart the machinations of Tiamat the Dragon Queen and the evil dragons that serve her.

MAP SCALE



# CLOISTER QUESTS

As the characters explore Dragon's Rest, the residents talk with them about the problems the cloister is facing. These conversations are opportunities for you to introduce the players to the adventures that await them in the sea caves, the shipwreck, and the ancient observatory.

This adventure is designed to be flexible and give the players the sense that they're in charge of their destiny on Stormwreck Isle. Ideally, the characters will spend time at Dragon's Rest and then explore both Seagrow Caves (described in chapter 2) and the wreck of *Compass Rose* (chapter 3). They can choose where to go first. After they've explored both of those sites, they should be ready to face Sparkrender in the Clifftop Observatory (chapter 4).

Each character sheet includes a personal goal for that character. Some of those goals are concrete—the wizard, for example, is eager to learn the secrets of Clifftop Observatory. Others are more general and might be fulfilled gradually over the course of the adventure—both the paladin and the fighter gaining a better understanding of their role in the world, for example. Use those goals (described under "Individual Quests" below) to help the players bring their characters to life as they interact with Runara and the other residents of Dragon's Rest.

## ZOMBIE RESURGENCE

If the adventurers did not fight the zombies when they first arrived on the island, the zombies cause trouble later. After the characters have spent some time at the cloister, they hear cries for help. Read the following text:

> Two residents of Dragon's Rest are running for their lives up the lower path, their fishing equipment discarded behind them. Blood and dirt stain their robes. Three figures shamble after them—bloated corpses dressed as sailors, moaning and gurgling.

The characters have another opportunity to fight the three **zombies**, this time with the lives of two new acquaintances—Blepp the kobold and Tarak the human gardener—hanging in the balance. See "Drowned Sailors" for help getting the encounter started.

Blepp has 2 hit points left after a zombie hit him, and he is convinced that his good luck and his "magical" dagger saved him from certain death. Tarak is unarmed, and the zombies overpower both him and Blepp if the characters don't help.

If the characters talk to Runara about the zombies, she tells them she suspects a wrecked ship off the rocks to the north is the source of these monsters, and she asks the characters to investigate the site (see "Shipwreck" below).

### MORE ZOMBIES

If the characters defeated the zombies when they first arrived on the island, you can use this encounter at any point during the adventure to add a little extra combat spice to the characters' lives. If the characters have already reached 2nd level, you can use from four to six zombies to give them a good challenge.

## SEA CAVES

Tarak is eager to reestablish contact with the myconids in the sea caves. He asks the characters to visit the caves, find out what's wrong with the myconids, and bring him back some heart cap mushrooms. He warns them about the fungal octopus the myconids have created as a guardian, and tells them they'll probably have to fight the creature to gain access to the caves. He also gives them a foul-smelling sack of food scraps they can give the myconids as a gesture of friendship. Finally, he gives them two *potions of healing* (described in appendix A).

## SHIPWRECK

Several ships have recently crashed on the rocks north of Dragon's Rest and sunk with no survivors, and a few days ago both Varnoth and the kobold Rix witnessed the most recent wreck. They saw the ship abruptly veer off course and crash into the rocks, and they suggest the characters might help the island by discovering what caused the crash. If the characters ask Runara about it, she suggests that the answer is likely to be found on an older wreck—the wreck of *Compass Rose*.

## INDIVIDUAL QUESTS

As described on the character sheets, the characters have their own reasons for visiting Dragon's Rest.

### THE CLERIC

The cleric was led here by a recurring dream involving the shadow of death. If the character talks to Runara about the dream or their quest, Runara listens closely, then pauses to think. "Well," she says, "I am no expert on interpreting dreams, but perhaps the zombies you fought are the 'hunger of death' you spoke of." She points the character toward the wreck of *Compass Rose* (see "Shipwreck" above) to investigate further.


# THE FIGHTER

The fighter has come to Dragon's Rest in the hope that Runara can help the character understand the sense of destiny that weighs on their shoulders. If the character talks to Runara about this on first arriving at the cloister, Runara invites the character to consider how their reaction to the zombies on the beach might reflect their destiny—or not. If the character talks to Runara after having completed one or more of the adventure's quests, she encourages the character to consider whether their heroic actions might be the first manifestations of that destiny taking shape. At the end of the adventure, Runara encourages the character to continue on their path: "If your destiny is not clear to you yet, I'm confident it soon will be."

# THE PALADIN

Disillusioned with the corruption of Neverwinter, the paladin comes to Dragon's Rest seeking rest and new resolve. Runara welcomes the character and encourages them to talk to Tarak and Varnoth, who both know about escaping lives of corruption and violence. She also encourages the paladin to spend time in the temple of Bahamut. At the end of the adventure, she asks the paladin if they have learned anything about how to live in a world plagued with such corruption. If the character has no answer, she suggests, "Perhaps your adventures here have shown you a way to combat evil on your own terms. Perhaps other such adventures await you."

# THE ROGUE

The rogue comes to Dragon's Rest in search of a lost fortune supposedly secreted away on the island by a member of the Gilded Gallows. The thieves' guild member in question is Tarak, who did in fact betray the guild, though the story has been twisted in the retelling. Tarak's last assignment for the guild

> **RUNARA SAVES THE DAY!**
> 
> Runara is a powerful dragon, but she is dedicated to the cause of peace. She's not interested in fighting the battles that the characters might get themselves into, but she keeps an eye on them, and she can rescue them if things go badly for them on the island.
> 
> If any encounter on the island ends with all the characters unconscious, you can have the characters awaken in the temple (area A5), with some of the kobolds tending to their wounds. Runara prefers not to explain how she rescued the characters.
> 
> If this happens more than once, the characters might need extra assistance more than once. If you haven't already, consider asking one or more players to play an additional character as a sidekick. You can explain that these additional characters have just arrived at Dragon's Rest and are eager to help.

was to assassinate a traitor, who was his lover. The two tried to flee Elturgard together, but his lover was killed by another assassin. Tarak escaped, but no treasure was involved. If the rogue asks him about it, he explains he has left the life of crime—and suggests perhaps it's time for the rogue to do the same.

# THE WIZARD

The wizard carries a letter from a colleague about lost knowledge held in the Clifftop Observatory (see chapter 4). If asked about the observatory, Runara says, "Many have sought the knowledge contained in that place. I can direct you there, but first you need to show me you are worthy." She promises to direct the wizard to the observatory after the characters help deal with the other problems on the island.

# LOST WYRMLING

When the characters have proven themselves trustworthy and competent by dealing with the zombies, the myconids, and the shipwreck, Runara decides it's time to confide in them. She summons them to the temple (area A5). Read the following text when the characters arrive:

> Elder Runara smiles as you approach. "I have something to show you," she says. There's a flash like a silent stroke of lightning, and the human woman is gone. In her place is an enormous dragon with bronze-colored scales. "Now you see me as I truly am," she says, tilting her head with an expression that might be a smile on her scaled face.
> 
> "As you have discovered, this island has many old wounds. And I'm afraid the cycle of violence is starting again. I have one more favor to ask you."

Runara outlines the history summarized in the "Adventure Background" section and explains that each site the characters visited is linked to the death of a dragon. Then she tells them that a bronze wyrmling named Aidron came to the island a few months ago and studied with her at Dragon's Rest. Five days before the characters' arrival, he argued with her, angrily rejected her teaching of peace, and stormed away from the cloister. She fears he went to the ancient observatory on the southeast side of the island, which is another dragon's final resting place. She suspects some evil has arisen there, but says she dares not go there herself, lest her presence reopen old wounds. She gives them a moonstone key—a 3-inch-long, 1-inch-wide hexagonal prism made from moonstone, with a dragon's head engraved on one end—and explains that they'll need it to access the observatory.


# EXPLORING THE ISLAND

This adventure presents Dragon's Rest and three adventure locations in detail, but Stormwreck Isle holds the possibility of excitement and danger beyond those sites. While the characters travel between locations on the island, or if they set out to explore the island, they might stumble across fantastical creatures and locations that provide an extra challenge on their journey.

## ADDITIONAL ENCOUNTERS

Place these encounters wherever you want to on the island, or use them as inspiration as you begin to craft your own adventures.

### HOT SPRINGS HAVOC

This encounter poses a simple challenge for characters of 2nd level or higher, or a harder challenge for 1st-level characters. It's particularly appropriate if the characters are rowing around the island or making their way along the coast at sea level.

> Billowing clouds of steam emerge from the rocks ahead, and the air grows thicker with moisture. As you round a bend, you see a cove where a hot spring bubbles up from the rocks and spills into a pool before draining into the ocean. The turquoise water is luminescent, and the gray basalt edges of the spring are lined with vibrantly colored mushrooms, which occasionally burst in a shower of rainbow spores.

Not immediately visible to the characters are the guardians of the spring: three **fume drakes**. These mischievous creatures are initially indifferent to the characters and ignore their arrival, but if anyone attempts to gather mushrooms or enter the water of the hot spring, the fume drakes become hostile, emerging from the water to attack the group. A character who examines the water and succeeds on a DC 10 Wisdom (


the kobolds' cheek result is surprised and loses their turn during the first round of combat (see "Surprise" in the rulebook). Read this text when the kobolds attack:

> A yipping sound erupts around you as angry kobolds emerge from their hiding places and attack!

Four **kobolds** and one **winged kobold** (all lawful evil) participate in this ambush. These cruel, vicious kobolds reject both the peaceful teaching of Runara and the tyrannical rule of Sparkrender, and they prey on travelers who stray away from Dragon's Rest. They haven't had much success and are desperate, so they're hostile and fight to the death.

Their desperation means that they can easily be persuaded to stop fighting with an offer of money or food. Otherwise, they're not interested in conversation or negotiation.

*2nd-Level Characters.* If the characters are 2nd level, use six kobolds and two winged kobolds.

*3rd-Level Characters.* If the characters are 3rd level, use eight kobolds and three winged kobolds.

## What Lies Beneath

As described in the "Adventure Background" section in the introduction, Stormwreck Isle was formed from magic-fueled volcanic activity in the tomb of a monstrous red dragon named Sharruth. Some legends and rumors suggest Sharruth is not actually dead, merely imprisoned beneath the island, and the activity in Seagrow Caves suggests that all is not well beneath Stormwreck Isle.

You can devise your own adventures around characters investigating Sharruth's tomb. Characters might scour the island until they find hidden vents they can use to access winding tunnels leading deep into the earth. More fume drakes and fire snakes might lurk below. Perhaps there's even a group of kobolds who serve mighty Sharruth.

Such an adventure is yours to devise, and you can put your unique spin on what the characters do and discover there. Of course, if you're not ready to craft an expedition into the caverns beneath the island, then the characters simply don't discover those subterranean passages no matter how much they search.


# CHAPTER 2
# SEAGROW CAVES

This chapter assumes the characters come here before going to the wreck of *Compass Rose*, and they are still 1st level. It also includes simple instructions to scale up the danger in combat encounters if the characters complete chapter 3, "Cursed Shipwreck," before coming here, and are now 2nd level.

## CAVES OVERVIEW

The sea caves on the southwest side of Stormwreck Isle are inhabited by an unusual colony of myconids—fungus people who normally live deep underground. Though they can't abide sunlight, these myconids used to welcome visitors now and then. In particular, they traded with Tarak from Dragon's Rest, giving him rare fungi that grow in their cavern in exchange for food scraps and other waste from the cloister, which nourished the fungi in the caves. Recently, though, the myconids have rejected Tarak's visits and placed a monstrous guardian at the entrance to their caves that keeps all visitors away.

The reason for this sudden shift in the myconids' behavior is that a blight has spread through the caves and is poisoning the myconids, twisting their gardens, and even laying low their leader, Sinensa. The source of the blight is the tomb of the red dragon Sharruth deep beneath the island. Noxious fumes from the dragon's tomb normally filter up through the rock and vent to the surface through a cavern at the back of Seagrow Caves that the myconids avoid, but the vent has become blocked, and the fumes have spilled into the myconids' caves.

Besides this insidious poison, visitors to Seagrow Caves must face one additional threat: the stirges that nest in the caves. These blood-sucking monsters aren't much of a threat individually and don't bother the bloodless myconids, but they can be deadly in large numbers.

## SEAGROW CAVES FEATURES

The caves have the following features:

**Ceilings.** Unless noted otherwise, the ceilings in the caverns are 20 feet high, and the tunnels connecting the caverns are 15 feet high.

**Light.** The interior caves are illuminated by bioluminescent fungi, which provide dim light throughout the area. See "Vision" in the rulebook.


# ENTERING THE CAVES

At high tide, the 40-foot-high tunnel (area B1) is flooded all the way to area B2. The natural stairways, which are not shown on the map of Seagrow Caves, descend the cliffs into the sea. The characters can either wait for low tide or row or swim into the tunnel. At low tide, a 5-foot-wide pathway is exposed along the base of the cliffs and the edge of the tunnel.

The tides shift every 6 hours, as summarized on the Tides table.

## TIDES

| Time                | Tide |
| ------------------- | ---- |
| Midnight to sunrise | Low  |
| Sunrise to noon     | High |
| Noon to sunset      | Low  |
| Sunset to midnight  | High |


# INTERACTING WITH MYCONIDS

The myconids' initial attitude toward outsiders is hostile (see "Social Interaction" in the rulebook). They aren't malicious, though, and they don't resort to violence immediately. Adults use their Rapport Spores to telepathically warn visitors to leave. (See "Rapport Spores" below for details about this form of communication.) Sprouts flee toward the nearest adults to warn them of intruders. If the characters attack, the myconids defend themselves.

To convince a hostile myconid to converse or to allow the characters to do anything other than leave the caves, a character must succeed on a DC 20 Charisma check. Depending on the character's approach, the Deception, Intimidation, or Persuasion skill can apply to the check. Mentioning Tarak's name or presenting the offering he sent the myconids grants advantage on this check.

An indifferent myconid is willing to explain what is going on in Seagrow Caves. The sprouts know only that their leader, Sinensa, has fallen ill—and that a nasty smell pervades their caves. Adult myconids know that the "crystal cave" (area B6) is the source of the foul odor and that Sinensa fell ill after going into that cave to investigate the issue. The myconids normally avoid that cave because sunlight filters into it by way of the vent at the western end of the cave, and even diffuse sunlight is unpleasant to these cave-dwelling creatures.

## RAPPORT SPORES

A myconid's Rapport Spores ability allows all intelligent creatures in the area to communicate telepathically with each other. The characters and the myconids are effectively speaking thoughts at each other. This effect doesn't allow any creature to probe

**Walls.** The cave walls are formed from hexagonal columns of dark gray basalt—volcanic rock originating from Sharruth's undersea tomb. The walls provide hand- and footholds, so climbing the walls doesn't require an ability check.

**Fumes.** Toxic volcanic fumes from deep below the island are slowly poisoning the fungi in the caves. A faint smell of sulfur pervades the place, growing stronger the closer one gets to area B6. If the characters take a long rest inside the caves before opening the vent in B6, each character must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned (see "Conditions" in the rulebook). The *lesser restoration* spell ends this effect, as does finishing a long rest in fresh air.

# RUNNING THIS CHAPTER

Once the characters decide to visit Seagrow Caves, they have two options for reaching the site:

**By Boat.** Dragon's Rest has a rowboat the characters can take around the western end of the island. (This is Tarak's preferred method.) The trip to Seagrow Caves is 5 miles, which takes about 3 hours and 20 minutes to row.

**Along the Coast.** Walking around the coast of the island is a little easier than rowing, even though it's farther because the characters have to walk around the bays instead of rowing across them. The 7-mile trip takes only 2 hours and 20 minutes at a normal walking pace. The characters can choose whether they want to walk on the cliffs high above the sea or pick their way among the tide pools at the base of the cliffs. The lower route is available only at low tide (see the Tides table).

## APPROACHING AT SEA LEVEL

If the characters arrive at Seagrow Caves at sea level, read the following text:

> A cliff of dark gray stone towers two hundred feet above the crashing waves, which rush in and out of a yawning cave mouth. A swirling slick of colors dances on the water's surface, emanating from the cave.

## APPROACHING FROM ABOVE

If the party approaches from above, read this text:

> An opening gapes in the cliff face two hundred feet below you, like a mouth drinking in the crashing waves. Two natural stairways formed of stone columns offer ways down the cliffs.



MAP 3: SEAGROW CAVES

# SEAGROW CAVES

[Map showing a cave system with various numbered locations (B1-B6) and features including "To Stairs Leading Up", "Sunken Walkway (Above Water at Low Tide)", and a compass rose. Scale: 1 Square = 5 Feet]

invasively into another creature's mind. But it transcends language barriers, and you can play around with the kind of communication that the spores allow. Myconids' facial expressions might be difficult to read, but their telepathic communication might carry a direct expression of the myconids' emotional state. For example, when the myconids talk about their ailing leader, the characters might feel a deep sadness and a sense of anxiety much more clearly and powerfully than mere words and facial expressions can communicate.

The effect of Rapport Spores lasts for 1 hour, so characters might be telepathically linked to each other whenever they're within 30 feet of each other even after they leave the cave. Encourage the players to think about how this might affect their characters. Does it make them feel closer to their friends? Does it ease any suspicions they might have had about each other?

## DISTRESS SPORES

When myconids take damage, they release spores that alert all other myconids within 240 feet of them. All myconids in the cave are in range of each other's Distress Spores. Myconids in areas B2 and B3 move to area B4 if they detect Distress Spores.

# SEAGROW CAVES LOCATIONS

The following locations are keyed to map 3, which shows the interior of the Seagrow Caves.

## B1. ENTRANCE TUNNEL

> Multicolored fungus covers the walls of this tunnel, its bioluminescent glow filling the cavern with dim light. The surface of the water swirls with colorful, faintly glowing spores—perhaps reacting to the movement of something under the surface.

At high tide, the tunnel is flooded, so visitors must approach by boat or swim. At low tide, walkways formed by the tops of stone columns line the sides of the tunnel, leading to a flight of natural steps up to area B2. A **spore servant octopus** lurks in the water and attacks any creatures (other than myconids) who enter the tunnel, regardless of the state of the tides. (Before the myconid leader lapsed into unconsciousness, it created this guardian to keep outsiders away.

As described on the previous page, the water level here varies by up to 10 feet with the tides. At high tide, the water is about 8 feet deep along the edges of the tunnel and 25 feet deep in the middle. At low


tide, the walkways along the edges are exposed, and the water is 15 feet deep in the middle.

*2nd-Level Characters.* If the characters are 2nd level, two **stirges** clinging to the tunnel ceiling are disturbed if fighting breaks out in this area and join the battle. The stirges ignore the spore servant.

## B2: FUNGUS FARM

> This fifty-foot-high cavern is a forest of multicolored fungi, ranging from tiny filaments to tree-sized mushrooms. A natural staircase of stone columns along the east wall leads up ten feet to a higher cave area in the north. Water burbles down from that upper cave and collects in a large pool. Two small mushroom-like people are working amid the mushrooms near the pond. A sickening smell, like sulfur, hangs in the air.

The waterfall is fed from a pool in the upper cave, which in turn is supplied by runoff trickling down from the surface. Both pools are 5 feet deep at most.

The two mushroom people are **myconid sprouts** named Molen and Kraz. They are spreading fertilizer from area B3, while two **myconid adults** named Hipsiz and Rugoso tend the mushrooms near the upper pool, out of sight from below. All four myconids are oblivious to the true threat in the cave—three **violet fungi** that grow among the harmless mushrooms here.

If the characters move into the cave toward the myconids, one violet fungus attacks them, extending long tendrils that cause immediate rot when they touch living flesh. Read this text:

> As you advance into the cave, a sickly looking mushroom suddenly stirs to life. It extends long purple tendrils toward you and moves slowly across the cave floor on root-like tendrils.

*Running the Combat.* Because the violet fungi move so slowly, it's easy for the characters to stay out of their reach and kill the fungus monsters with ranged attacks. The interesting part of this encounter is identifying the danger. One violet fungus moves and attacks to start the encounter, but the other two remain motionless until characters move close to them.

You don't need to keep track of exactly where everyone is standing in the room. Instead, rely on your sense of what's fun and exciting. When a character moves away from an active violet fungus, have another fungus stir and attack that character on the fungus's next turn. If a character scans the fungus farm looking for more violet fungi, cast as much doubt as you can: many of the fungi look sickly and purple but pose no danger.

*Myconids.* The myconid sprouts avoid the characters and the violet fungi. If the adults become aware of danger through the noise of combat (or the sprouts' Distress Spores), they move as quickly as they can to protect the sprouts.

If the characters defeat the violet fungi, the myconids' attitude improves to indifferent, and they are willing to speak to the characters (using their Rapport Spores). The adults agree to accompany the characters and vouch for them with the rest of the myconid colony, improving the other myconids' attitude to indifferent as well.

*Blighted Fungi.* A character who examines any of the fungi notices that many of the mushrooms are sickly, shriveled, and blotched with black patches of decay. The blight has no obvious source.

*Treasure.* The fungus farm contains heart cap mushrooms ready for harvest. A character who spends 15 minutes searching this chamber for useful fungi and succeeds on a DC 12 Intelligence (Nature) or Wisdom (Survival) check finds 1d6 of these reddish mushrooms, which bear an unsettling resemblance to human hearts. Tarak can make each heart cap mushroom into a *potion of healing*.

*2nd-Level Characters.* If the characters are 2nd level, add two violet fungi to this encounter.

## B3: LARDER

> This cave reeks of rot, and the floor is covered with decaying vegetation. Three small mushroom-folk are working amid the filth. In the southwest corner of the cave, a bulbous object the size of a cart clings to the wall and ceiling, glistening like a glob of jelly.

Three **myconid sprouts** named Bispo, Valup, and Popple work here gathering fertilizer for use in area B2. The bulbous object is a stirge nest, which characters can identify with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Nature) check. If a character moves more than 5 feet into the chamber, **six stirges** emerge from the nest and attack. Meanwhile, the sprouts flee toward area B4 at the first sign of intruders, relying on the distraction of the stirges to escape.

*2nd-Level Characters.* If the characters are 2nd level, add two stirges to this encounter.


## B4: CIRCLE CHAMBER

> Six clusters of giant mushrooms are arranged in a rough circle around this cavern. Several human-sized mushroom folk stand in a circle in the center of the cave. The smell of sulfur is stronger here.

Six **myconid adults** are here. Two of them (named Agric and Omphalo) are tending to the other four (Craterel, Pleuro, Subrufus, and Virosa), who are standing stock-still in a dream-like trance called a meld, experiencing a shared transcendent state. The two conscious myconids move quickly to confront any intruders who aren't escorted by other myconids, and they respond with violence to any threat. All six myconids are ill and fatigued from the blight that is spreading through the caves, so they take turns resting here.

## B5: SINENSA'S SANCTUM

> Glowing fungus and colorful crystals grow from the walls and ceilings of this smaller cave. In the middle of the cave, two human-sized mushroom folk tend to a larger specimen of their kind. The large one is shriveled and covered with unhealthy purple blotches, and it does not move.

Two **myconid adults** named Auranta and Enok are tending the unconscious myconid who leads this colony, **Sinensa**. The adults collect spores from a barrel-sized, glowing red fungus that vaguely resembles a human brain and puff the spores around the leader's head. The treatment is keeping the leader alive for now, but it is a losing battle. Sinensa's only hope is for the blight to end. The adults zealously defend their leader, immediately attacking intruders who aren't accompanied by other myconids.

*Treasure.* If the characters bring the glowing red fungus, called a ruby of the war god, back to the cloister, Tarak uses it to make them an *elixir of health* (described in appendix A).

## B6: CRYSTAL CAVE

> The air in this cave is choked with thick smoke that assaults your nostrils with a pungent odor of brimstone. Strange, flickering orange light illuminates the smoke. This area is free of fungal growth; instead, crystals grow from the rock. To your right, a large cluster of purple crystals juts from the stone. On the far wall, a glowing orange crystal wedged into a fissure in the cave wall seems to be the source of the light. Streaks of soot trace a path along the cave walls between the purple crystals and the fissure.

Two **fume drakes** lurk amid the sulfurous fumes. These elemental creatures look like little dragons formed entirely of greenish smoke. They don't leave this cave, but they rush to attack any creature that enters it.

This cave is the source of the blight spreading through the myconid colony. As the characters explore the cave, they can easily determine that the noxious fumes from deep beneath the island seep up around the vein of purple crystals. Ordinarily, the fumes vent to the surface through a fissure in the west wall, but the fissure is now blocked by the enormous orange crystal, which is also the source of the light here.

The heart of the problem is the tomb of the red dragon Sharruth, deep beneath the island. The presence of such a powerful dragon far underground causes the volcanic activity that produces the noxious fumes. What's more, the dragon's energy occasionally tears open small rifts in the fabric of reality that lead to the Elemental Plane of Fire—another dimension of reality that is the cosmic source of fiery energy. The Plane of Fire is the origin of both the orange crystal blocking the vent (which is actually an **egg case**) and the creatures currently in the cave.

*Fire Crystal.* Destroying the orange crystal by blocking the western fissure allows the noxious fumes to escape the cave and stops the blight that is harming the myconids. A single strong whack with a weapon, a crowbar, or other tool is sufficient to shatter it. When the crystal breaks, a two-foot-diameter sphere of smoldering obsidian falls to the floor amid the other pieces and breaks open, releasing a **fire snake** from this stony egg. Seeing the characters only as fuel, it attacks them at once.

Breaking the fire crystal also reveals the reason the myconids avoid this cave: the cave is immediately filled with shimmering sunlight refracted through the crystals that line the vent. Bright light fills the entire area.


# ENDING THIS CHAPTER

If the characters destroy the orange crystal so the toxic fumes can escape the caves, the myconids' attitude improves to friendly. Sinensa, the myconid leader, regains consciousness the following morning. If the characters are present when Sinensa awakens, Sinensa gives them the ruby morel from area B5 and permission to keep any other treasure or mushrooms they collected in the caves.

Once the characters return to Dragon's Rest, Tarak can use the ruby morel to make an *elixir of health* (described in appendix A), which he gives to the characters in gratitude for their efforts.

**Treasure.** The fire snake's egg breaks into 25 tiny chunks of obsidian worth 10 gp each.

*2nd-Level Characters.* If the characters are 2nd level, add a third fume drake to the room when the characters first arrive. Then, at the same time the fire snake hatches from its egg, two more fume drakes emerge from the cluster of purple crystals.

# GAIN A LEVEL

After they complete this chapter of the adventure, the characters gain a level. If they visited Seagrow Caves before the wreck of *Compass Rose*, they advance from 1st level to 2nd level. The residents of Dragon's Rest urge them to visit the wreck of *Compass Rose* next (see "Shipwreck" on page 12).

If they've already explored the wreck of *Compass Rose* in chapter 3, they advance from 2nd level to 3rd level and are ready to visit Clifftop Observatory in chapter 4. (See "Lost Wyrmling" on page 13.

The character sheets explain what happens when characters gain a level.



CHAPTER 3
# CURSED SHIPWRECK

THIS CHAPTER ASSUMES THE CHARACTERS COME here before Seagrow Caves and are still 1st level. It also includes instructions to scale up the danger in combat encounters if the characters complete chapter 2, "Seagrow Caves," before coming here and are now 2nd level.

## SHIPWRECK OVERVIEW

Ever since the violent death of a gold dragon on the rocky shoal on the north side of Stormwreck Isle, the bone-strewn rocks have been the site of many shipwrecks through the centuries. One such shipwreck left a lasting mark on the island.

About forty years ago, a ship named *Compass Rose* carrying passengers bound for the cloister wrecked on the shoal, killing all aboard. To the horror of the cloister's residents, those who drowned found their way ashore as shambling zombies. Since the loss of that ship, each new shipwreck has brought a fresh wave of zombie sailors to the island's shore. Fortunately, wrecks are rare—or they were, until recently.

Not long ago, a harpy settled into the wreck of *Compass Rose*. With its magically entrancing voice, the harpy has been luring ships to crash on the shoal and feasting on the unlucky sailors. The sailors who escape the harpy's talons end up as zombies menacing the people of Dragon's Rest.

The harpy is only the most immediate problem lurking in the wrecked hull of *Compass Rose*. The greater threat is a cursed talisman held in the ship's

> ### OTHER SHIPWRECKS
> 
> This chapter assumes the characters heed Runara's advice and search *Compass Rose* for clues to the recent shipwrecks. If the characters decide to explore other recent wrecks, you can use the map of *Compass Rose* to represent any other sunken ship's deck plan, though most of the wrecks are entirely underwater. Characters exploring other wrecks might find more zombies—sailors killed in the wrecks who were animated by the talisman in *Compass Rose*'s hold but couldn't get off their ships for some reason. They might also find giant octopuses (you can use the spore servant octopus stat block from appendix B), ghouls, or other dangers aboard. These adventures are yours to create, but only the wreck of *Compass Rose* holds the secret to freeing Dragon's Rest from the zombie attacks.


hold, imbued with magic by a long-dead sailor's desperate prayers to a demon lord. This curse is responsible for the drowned sailors animating as zombies. Most of the sailors who were aboard the ship when it wrecked are long gone, but some zombies have been trapped in the wreck for years.

## SHIPWRECK FEATURES

The wreck of *Compass Rose* is located at the northern end of a long spur of sharp rocks and dragon bones jutting from the ocean waves, about 2½ miles from the cloister. It remains mostly above the water, held up by the ancient bones that tore its hull. The wreck has the following features:

**Walls.** The soggy wooden walls are aged to a sickly black and green. Algae and barnacles grow on walls throughout the wreck.

**Ceilings.** The ceilings in the ship are 8 feet high.

**Doors.** The doorways are 6 feet high, and the doors are in the same waterlogged condition as the walls.

**Light.** During the day, the sun fills the upper deck and main deck with bright light and the lower deck with dim light. Sunlight doesn't reach into the hold, and the whole wreck is dark at night. See "Vision" in the rulebook.

# RUNNING THIS CHAPTER

Dragon's Rest has a rowboat the characters can take to visit the wreck of *Compass Rose*. The trip of 2½ miles takes about 1 hour and 40 minutes to row. When the characters arrive, read this text:

> Waves lap against a derelict ship lodged against a ridge of rocks and enormous dragon bones. A faint odor of rot wafts on the sea air, along with the sound of screeching seagulls and the roar of the surf. A tangled mess of tattered sails and rigging hangs off the starboard side of the main deck, offering one possible way to climb aboard. At the stern, you can make out a gaping hole in the hull beneath the water line.

If the characters pull the rowboat up to the south (starboard) side of the ship, they can easily tie up the little boat to the derelict's rigging and climb onto the main deck (area C1). However, they're free to explore other possibilities for getting aboard, such as swimming through the hole in the hold (area C9).

# SHIPWRECK LOCATIONS

The following locations are keyed to map 4, which shows the layout of the shipwreck.

## C1. MAIN DECK

> The moldering wood of the deck is slick with algae and seawater. Amid the tangle of rigging, splintered railings, and stray seaweed, you spot boots, bones, and bits of gore that seem considerably more recent than the wreck of this ship.
>
> Stairs lead to upper decks at fore and aft, and doors lead into cabins under those decks. The mainmast remains intact and mostly upright, topped with a crow's nest overflowing with debris. A staircase near the mast and a large hatch on the port side both lead down into the hold.

*Crow's Nest.* A rope ladder runs up the mast to the crow's nest, secure despite the condition of the wreck. The mast sways alarmingly as characters climb, and at the top of the 50-foot climb the characters find that they are leaning out over the water on the port (north) side of the ship.

The crow's nest now serves as a nest for the harpy that has made *Compass Rose* its lair. The basket-shaped area is stuffed with wood shavings, dry grass, and shredded canvas from ships' sails. Bits of bones, tufts of hair, and shiny baubles are also visible in the harpy's nest.

*Harpy's Return.* When the characters arrive at the shipwreck, the harpy is out looking for another ship to lure onto the rocks. It returns after the characters have spent some time aboard, as described in "Harpy's Return" later in this chapter.

*Treasure.* Characters who search through the crow's nest find a small gold bracelet worth 25 gp, a single gold hoop earring worth 25 gp, two small tiger eye gems worth 10 gp each, and one bloodstone gem worth 50 gp.

## C2. FORECASTLE

> The broken foremast leans out across a broken railing, with a tangle of rigging and tattered canvas trailing down to the rocks and dragon bones below. A rusted and rotting ballista stands near the broken mast.

The ballista no longer works. There's nothing of interest to find here.


## C3: QUARTERDECK

> The splintered remains of a mast jut up from this rear deck like a broken spear. The ship's wheel is askew, dislodged from its mechanism.

The wheel bears the name of the ship—*Compass Rose*—engraved and inlaid with mother-of-pearl, though in the wheel's current position the name is upside down. If a character turns the wheel, it snaps free of its axle and falls. If the character tries to catch the wheel before it hits the deck, ask the player to make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw. On a successful save, the character catches the wheel. On a failed save, the wheel hits the deck with a loud thud that catches the attention of the zombies in area C4. A moment later, the thud is answered by a loud crash against the door to C4, which repeats every 10 to 15 seconds.

### C4: CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS

The door to the captain's quarters is barricaded from the inside, though the heavy wooden bar blocking the door is half rotten. A character who tries to force the door open can break it down with a successful DC 10 Strength check.

> The door crashes open to reveal two drowned sailors in a cabin that must once have been luxurious. A bookcase, half collapsed, holds waterlogged and disintegrating books and scrolls. The polished wood desk leans awkwardly on three legs; it has an ornate compass set in its center. The bed is covered in rotting bedding and sags in the middle. A jagged hole gapes in the floor beside the bed.

If the characters dropped the wheel in area C3 or needed more than one Strength check to open the door into this room, the two **zombies** are beside the door when it opens. Otherwise, they're aimlessly shuffling around the cabin. In either case, they move to attack the characters right away.

*Hole to the Hold.* The hole beside the captain's bed formed when the rotting floorboards collapsed under the weight of the captain's sea chest. It broke through the floor of the lower deck (area C8) as well, coming to rest in the hold (area C9).

*Treasure.* Two small drawers in the desk hold a pouch containing 50 gp, a set of cartographer's tools, and a dagger. The compass set in the desktop can easily be pried free; it is worth 25 gp.

*2nd-Level Characters.* If the characters are 2nd level, add a third zombie to this encounter.

## C5: GALLEY

> A long-dead, headless skeleton sits propped up against a counter to the right, but the galley is otherwise empty. Unless ... did the skeleton just move?

Small, harmless crabs are crawling over the skeletal remains, causing the illusion of movement.

### C6: CREW QUARTERS

> Six double bunks line the edges of this cabin. Personal effects are strewn about the room, and a faded, painted portrait hangs on one wall.

The portrait shows a young couple smiling and embracing. Written across the bottom of the portrait are the words "Aleitha and Brastor—together forever." The black-haired woman wears a sailor's uniform similar to the tatters worn by the zombies aboard this ship. The blond-haired man wears a merchant's fine clothes.

*Floorboard Stash.* A character who searches the cabin and succeeds on a DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check notices a floorboard in the middle of the room that is raised slightly above its neighbors. A character who lifts the floorboard triggers a trap: a tiny dart shoots up, making an attack against the character. Its attack bonus is +5. If it hits, it deals 2 (1d4) piercing damage, and the character must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or take 3 (1d6) poison damage. Once the trap is triggered, it does not trigger again unless a character resets it. (If the characters figure out a way to lift the floorboard from a safe distance, the dart misses.)

*Treasure.* A sack full of 200 gp rests in a small compartment beneath the raised floorboard.

### C7: MESS HALL

> A long table takes up most of this cabin, which must have served as a mess hall. Decaying chairs are scattered about, and broken glass and crockery litter the floor.

There's nothing of interest to find here.

MAP 4: THE WRECK OF COMPASS ROSE

## C8: LOWER DECK

> The descent to the lower deck is chilly, wet, and unsettling. Seawater obscures the floor and sloshes against the hull. Decaying crates and barrels are scattered around, some floating freely and others stacked into corners. You hear splashing as a walking corpse lumbers toward you, wading in water that doesn't quite reach its knees.

The **zombie** is an obvious threat, but another Undead monster—a **ghoul**—lurks in the aft part of the hold. Much more cunning than the zombies, the ghoul waits to attack until the characters are busy with the zombie. It hopes to paralyze a character with its Claw attack, then drag the paralyzed character away to feast on while the other characters contend with the zombie. Unlike the zombies, the ghoul is not a former member of the ship's crew, but a vile scavenger drawn by the presence of decaying flesh.

The water on the lower deck ranges from about 6 inches deep on the starboard (south) side of the ship to 18 inches deep on the port (north) side. The water makes the entire lower deck difficult terrain (see "Difficult Terrain" in the rulebook).

### *Hole to the Hold*

*Hole to the Hold.* A hole in the ceiling in the northwest part of the lower deck area leads up to the captain's quarters (area C4). It's matched by a similar hole directly below it. The holes were caused by the captain's chest falling through the floorboards all the way to the hold, where it came to rest (see area C9).

*2nd-Level Characters.* If the characters are 2nd level, add two zombies to this encounter.

**Treasure.** Some of the goods in the crates here remain valuable. Using a crowbar, a character can pry open a crate in 1 minute; without a crowbar, it takes 10 minutes. When a character opens a crate, roll a d6 and consult the Crate Contents table to determine what's inside. The characters can find each item on the table once.

### CRATE CONTENTS

| d6 | Contents                                                                             |
| -- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1  | Five bottles of fine wine (worth 10 gp each) packed in straw, plus one broken bottle |
| 2  | A 20-pound sack of whole cloves, worth 60 gp                                         |
| 3  | Ten small, 1-pound bars of silver (worth 5 gp each)                                  |
| 4  | A pair of candlestick holders carved from bone to resemble dragons, worth 25 gp each |
| 5  | A fine lute with mother-of-pearl inlay, worth 50 gp                                  |
| 6  | A *spell scroll of command* (see appendix A), sealed in a leather case               |


MAP SET 4



# C9: HOLD

As the cold water engulfs you, a strange undersea world is revealed. Colorful seaweed grows over the shattered hull, especially around the gaping hole in the stern of the ship. Tiny fish dart among hunks of debris and cargo.

See "Climbing, Swimming, and Crawling" and "Suffocating" in the "The Environment" section of the rulebook as the characters venture into the submerged hold. Fortunately for them, unless something goes wrong, there's no significant time pressure on the characters as they swim around here. They can surface (at the hole in area C8's floor, or at the top of the stairs up to C8) to breathe as often as they need to.

**Captain's Chest.** A heavy iron chest lies on the floor of the hold, directly beneath the hole it fell through. If a character opens the chest here, a large air bubble rushes out, and a packet, wrapped and sealed in waxed fabric, rises up after it. Though the chest is heavy (about 125 pounds), the characters can also carry it to the surface before opening it.

The chest contains a pouch holding 55 gp and three turquoise stones (worth 10 gp each), as well as a pair of *boots of elvenkind*. The floating packet contains the captain's journal, which has been keep safe from the water by its wrapping. A braid of hair is stuck in the pages like a bookmark, indicating the log's last entry. The last entry reads as follows:

## 19 Tarsakh

Our journey is ended, though I fear my own is to continue in the most horrible way imaginable. *Compass Rose* wrecked on a shoal south of Neverwinter. Many sailors perished with the initial impact, and Aleitha was gravely injured. As I tended her wounds, she clutched her talisman and breathed soft prayers. I asked her what the talisman signified. She told me love. Her husband waits for her at Dragon's Rest, having pledged his service to the dragon there. The talisman is made from locks of their hair, woven together as a promise to be reunited no matter what fate might befall them. It might have been a beautiful story, had it not been for Aleitha's gruesome end—and the words of the prayer I heard as she breathed her last. For she was begging Orcus, the Prince of Undeath, to reunite her with her husband.

I held her hands as the breath left her, and I felt a horrible chill pass through her. Next I knew, she was sinking her teeth into my neck. At the same moment, I heard moans begin to rise from the dead sailors all around us. What curse has she brought on us all?

Already I feel a creeping chill overtaking my body. I am securing her talisman with this book in my chest, in the hope that someone who comes after us may end this nightmare by bringing Altheia's talisman to her husband.

The talisman is formed from long locks of hair—some blonde, some black—braided together and knotted around two small finger bones. If a character casts *detect magic*, the talisman is revealed to carry magic of the school of necromancy. See "Ending This Chapter" for more about the talisman.

Tarsakh is a month in the calendar of the Forgotten Realms, roughly corresponding to April. No year is specified in the log.

**About Orcus.** Known as the Demon Prince of Undeath and the Blood Lord, the demon lord Orcus is a fiend whose power rivals that of the gods. Ruling over hordes of demons in the nightmarish plane of existence called the Abyss, Orcus yearns to transform the multiverse into a ghastly place of death. Many Undead creatures (like ghouls) worship him or seek to bargain with him in exchange for some fragment of his power over undeath.

**A New Threat.** After the characters find the captain's chest, when they come up from the hold to the lower deck, they hear a heavy thump on the deck above them as the harpy lands on the main deck. See "Harpy's Return" below.



HARPY'S RETURN | ENDING THIS CHAPTER

# HARPY'S RETURN

The **harpy** that makes its lair in the crow's nest (area C1) returns to the ship when one of these conditions is met:

* The characters find the captain's chest in the hold (area C9) and return to the lower deck (area C8).
* The characters finish a short or long rest on the ship.

The next time the characters show themselves on the main deck, the harpy confronts them:

> A terrifying monster perches on the top of the crow's nest, spreading its scraggly wings and screeching harshly. Its wings and legs resemble those of a mangy vulture, while its head, torso, and arms look almost human. It clutches a large bone like a club and flexes its talons.

On its first turn, the harpy uses its Luring Song in an attempt to charm the characters and draw them up to the crow's nest. A character charmed by the harpy's Luring Song thinks it's the most beautiful sound they have ever heard. It's easy to imagine how a ship might be lured off course to get closer to the source of this music.

## TALKING TO THE HARPY

The harpy is cruel and hungry for flesh, but it speaks Common and can be reasoned with. It's not easy to convince the bloodthirsty monster to change its ways and leave the wreck of *Compass Rose*, but if the players come up with a strong argument (possibly supported with high rolls on Charisma checks), the harpy cooperates. These tactics are the most likely to convince the harpy to leave:

* If the characters have already reduced the harpy to fewer than half its hit points, it might flee.
* If the characters claimed the treasure from the crow's nest while the harpy was absent, it might agree to leave in exchange for the return of its treasure.
* If the characters are 2nd level and two harpies are present (see below), characters can play on the distrust between the two harpies and might convince them to part ways and leave the area.

## 2ND-LEVEL CHARACTERS

If the characters are 2nd level, add a second harpy to the encounter. This harpy initially perches on the ballista in area C2 and uses its own Luring Song. Although they're allies, the harpies don't trust each other.

# ENDING THIS CHAPTER

If the characters defeat the harpy, one problem is solved: no more ships will be lured to the rocks, and shipwrecks will once again be a rarity.

If the characters find Aleitha's talisman in the hold, they can solve the zombie problem entirely. If they bring the talisman to Runara and explain what they found in the captain's log, Runara nods sadly. She remembers Aleitha's husband, Brastos, but he died many years ago. He was laid to rest in the graveyard atop the cliffs at the northern point of the island, northwest of Dragon's Rest.

The graves in the little clifftop cemetery are covered in white wildflowers and marked with simple wooden slabs. If the characters lay the talisman on Brastos's grave, bury it in the soil over the grave, or burn it atop the grave, the wind seems to sigh in relief. Thick fog forms around the rocks north of the island. The fog lingers overnight, and when it disperses, no trace of *Compass Rose* remains.

The characters might also disregard the words of the captain's journal and destroy the talisman while aboard the ship. This also breaks the curse—the characters still feel something like a sigh in the air, fog rises up to engulf the wreck while the characters are rowing away, and the ship is gone when the fog lifts the next day.

If the characters undo the talisman's curse, the next time they sleep, the cleric character has another dream. Read this text to the cleric's player:

> In your dream, you are once again on the deck of the ship that brought you here, and you see Stormwreck Isle shrouded in darkness, just as it was in your earlier dreams. As you sail closer, the darkness breaks, and a dazzling ray of sunlight shines down over the island. A gentle plume of white smoke rises up from the island as the darkness is driven away. Then the darkness and the smoke are gone, the light swells to enfold you as well, and you feel the love and approval of your god.

# GAIN A LEVEL

After they complete this chapter of the adventure, the characters gain a level. If they visited *Compass Rose* before Seagrow Caves, they advance to 2nd level. The residents of Dragon's Rest urge them to visit Seagrow Caves next (see "Sea Caves" on page 12). If the characters have already explored the caves, they advance to 3rd level and are ready to visit Clifftop Observatory in chapter 4. See "Lost Wyrmling" on page 13.

The character sheets explain what happens when characters gain a level.


# CHAPTER 4
# CLIFFTOP OBSERVATORY

This chapter assumes the characters visit the observatory after exploring Seagrow Caves and the wreck of *Compass Rose*, and thus have reached 3rd level. If they come here before visiting the other adventure sites, the combat encounters are probably too difficult for them. That's the reason Runara won't give the characters the moonstone key or information about the observatory until after they've dealt with the island's other problems. If necessary, you can have Runara warn the characters that they're not ready to face this part of the adventure yet.

## OBSERVATORY OVERVIEW

During its heyday, the Clifftop Observatory was a marvel of magical innovation. Adorned with gorgeous stained glass windows and marble spires, the observatory's towers stood high above the churning sea on separate islets, linked by shimmering bridges of magical energy. But the observatory was wrecked when Runara battled her blue dragon rival centuries ago, and now it lies in ruin, a crumbled memory overtaken by nature.

In recent months, the observatory ruins have become the home of an arrogant blue dragon wyrmling called Sparkrender, a descendant of Runara's ancient rival. Like his ancestor, Sparkrender seeks to claim the destructive magic that lingers at the site. Like Runara, Sparkrender has recruited kobolds to join his cause.

About five days before the characters arrived on the island, a bronze dragon wyrmling named Aidron left the safety of Dragon's Rest and Runara's tutelage and came to the ancient observatory. The two wyrmlings met and immediately clashed. Sparkrender attempted to turn the bronze wyrmling against Runara, but Aidron's hatred of chromatic dragons was stronger than his disagreement with Runara. Ultimately, Sparkrender overpowered Aidron and imprisoned him in the observatory ruins.

Sparkrender believes Aidron is the key to unlocking the observatory's magic and claiming his ancestor's power. With the bronze wyrmling imprisoned, Sparkrender began planning a ritual that will awaken the spirits of all the island's dead dragons and bind them to his will—at the cost of Aidron's life.


# OBSERVATORY FEATURES

The observatory is built on a series of basalt spires jutting up from the ocean at the southeastern tip of Stormwreck Isle. Almost all the structure's former ceilings and walls have crumbled away, exposing the ruins to the open air.

Unless otherwise noted, the ruins stand 30 feet above the ocean's surface. The rugged cliffs offer abundant hand- and footholds, so a character who jumps or falls into the water and survives (see "Falling" in the rulebook) can climb back up without needing to make an ability check.

# RUNNING THIS CHAPTER

Once the characters decide to visit the Clifftop Observatory, they have three options for reaching the site:

**By Boat.** Dragon's Rest has a rowboat the characters can take around the eastern end of the island. The trip to the observatory is 5 miles, which takes about 3 hours and 20 minutes to row.

**Along the Coast.** Walking around the coast of the island is a little easier than rowing, and a quicker trip despite the characters having to walk around the eastern bay instead of rowing across it. The 6-mile trip takes only 2 hours at a normal walking pace.

**Overland.** The characters can walk southeast from Dragon's Rest to the head of the bay, where a rough path cuts across the island to the eastern bay. The rocky ground of the island is difficult terrain, but this is still the fastest and most direct route. Characters can make the 3½-mile trip in about 1 hour and 15 minutes.

# APPROACHING BY LAND

If the characters approach the observatory by land, read the following text:

> Clambering over the rocky ground of Stormwreck Isle, you spot strange, twisted protrusions of glassy crystal jutting from the earth. The vegetation in this area bears reddish branching scars that form similar shapes. Suddenly, you hear a screeching roar and notice a winged, glittering blue shape swooping overhead.

The blue shape is Sparkrender flying by. This glimpse of the dragon is an opportunity to make your players nervous about the foe they're about to face. Feel free to elaborate on the description of Sparkrender and play on the characters' worry that he might spot them, but ultimately he passes by without noticing them. The characters see him come to rest on a rocky spire off the coast as he returns to his hoard among the ruins (area D5).

A character who examines the crystalline protrusions or the scarred vegetation can make a DC 10 Intelligence (Nature) check. On a success, the character recognizes the phenomenon as a sign of lightning strikes—or the lightning breath of a blue or bronze dragon.

Assuming the characters continue toward the observatory, they soon arrive at area D1, described below.

# APPROACHING BY WATER

If the characters row to the observatory, read this text instead:

> As you round the southeastern tip of the island, you can see crumbling ruins atop basalt columns just off the main island body. If you pull the boat ashore on the island, it would be an easy walk up to the top of the cliffs, though there is no obvious bridge from the cliffs to the ruins. Alternatively, you could tie the boat up at the bottom of the columns and try to climb directly up to the ruins.
>
> As you consider these options, you hear a screeching roar and notice a winged, glittering blue shape swooping through the air ahead of you. The figure comes to rest atop the column farthest from Stormwreck Isle and vanishes from sight.

Again, Sparkrender does not notice the characters as he returns to his lair, but feel free to tease the players with the idea that he *might* notice them.

If the characters beach the boat on the shore, they can easily climb the bluffs to area D1, described below. If they tie up the boat at the base of one of the pillars, they can instead climb to the area atop it (area D2, D3, D4, or D5).

# SPARKRENDER'S KOBOLD ALLIES

The kobolds who joined forces with Sparkrender are lawful evil and cruel. Their initial reaction toward outsiders is hostile (see "Social Interaction" in the rulebook), but they're more likely to warn intruders to leave the ruins than to immediately attack. They readily threaten violence and back up their threats with combat if necessary.

As an action, a character can try to convince a hostile kobold to have a conversation or to allow the characters to explore the area, doing so on a successful DC 15 Charisma check. Depending on the character's approach, the Deception, Intimidation, or Persuasion skill can apply to the check.



CLIFFTOP OBSERVATORY

# MAP 5: CLIFFTOP OBSERVATORY

This list summarizes what the kobolds know:

**Kobold History.** The kobolds here have served Sparkrender for about a year. They revere the blue dragon as a semidivine figure and trust him to provide for their every need.

**Big Plans.** Sparkrender has big plans that will allow him to manifest his full power. The wyrmling is waiting for the sculpture in the rotunda ruins (area D2) to tell him it's time to act. The kobolds think it must be soon—possibly even today.

**Dragon Visitor.** Not long ago, another dragon arrived. This other dragon was about Sparkrender's size but looked like greenish-yellow metal. They remember hearing the two arguing at the observatory tower (area D5), and they have heard the other dragon roaring and crashing around inside the tower (area D6) since then.

**Caved-In Wall.** Though the kobolds have been trying to tidy the ruins, Sparkrender specifically told them not to clean up the newly caved-in wall at the base of the observatory tower (area D6). The caved-in wall is visible from area D3.

# OBSERVATORY LOCATIONS

The following locations are keyed to map 5, which shows the layout of the Clifftop Observatory.

## D1: OVERLOOK

> A broken and overgrown path winds to the edge of the cliff. The overlook is marked by two marble statues veined with gold, each carved in the shape of a dragon with its mouth open in a silent roar.

At the base of each statue is a small hexagonal indentation, about 1 inch wide and 2 inches deep—perfectly sized to accommodate the moonstone key Runara gave them.

When the key is inserted into the base of either statue, magical light sparks to life in both statues' open mouths, and a shimmering bridge made of iridescent magical energy extends from the overlook to the observatory ruins (area D2). The bridge is sturdy and lasts until the key is removed from the statue.

MAP&CARDS



# D2: ROTUNDA RUINS

> Broken stone lines this plaza—fragments of elegant statues, once-magnificent pillars, and shining marble walls. At the center, a tall sculpture of rusted planets and gilded stars spins idly in a jerky mimicry of celestial motion.
>
> A gargled screech suddenly rises from across the plaza. A half-dozen batlike creatures are swarming around two winged kobolds with blue paint smeared across their long snouts. The kobolds are fighting fiercely, but they seem close to being overwhelmed.

The two **winged kobolds** are locked in battle with eight **stirges**. When the characters enter the area, six of the stirges turn their attention to this new, juicier prey. The kobolds try to deal with the remaining two stirges, and then decide what to do based on what the characters are doing. If the characters actively help the kobolds during the battle, then the kobolds return the favor. If the characters attack the kobolds instead of (or as well as) the stirges, the kobolds fight back. Otherwise, the kobolds hang back, trying to stay out of the way until the fight is over.

Once the stirges have been defeated, if the kobolds survive, they approach the characters. Their names are Mek and Minn, and they're the brothers of Myla, the kobold tinkerer at Dragon's Rest. They left their sister for dead after the stirge attack that maimed her wings. They have sworn loyalty to Sparkrender, and they share the dragon's cruel, haughty demeanor.

If the characters actively helped the kobolds or mention that Myla is alive, the kobolds' attitude becomes friendly. They offer to introduce the characters to their leader and help the characters in any way they can (such as retrieving the moonstone key from area D1 so the characters can activate the bridge to D4). They won't help the characters fight Sparkrender, though; they are loyal to the dragon.

**Golden Sculpture.** The sculpture in the center of the rotunda is an astronomical model used for research in centuries past. The sculpture depicts the planet of Toril (the world of the Forgotten Realms), its moon (called Selûne), the sun, and seven other planets, as well as one comet with a very eccentric orbit. A character who studies the sculpture can puzzle out its importance with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check: its current position suggests the comet will soon pass very close to Toril.

Sparkrender plans to hold his ritual when the comet is at its closest point. He believes the comet, called the King-Killer Star, controls the destiny of dragons and will allow him to claim the power of the dragons who fell on Stormwreck Isle.

**Dragon Effigies.** The stirge attack interrupted the kobolds from their assigned task of preparing this site for Sparkrender's ritual. With the wyrmling's help, they have crudely sculpted five chunks of rubble into vaguely draconic shapes and splashed each one with paint, and the kobolds were in the process of arranging them around the metal sculpture. Each effigy has the name of the dragon it represents etched into it. These are the names and colors of the five dragons:

| Name      | Color  |
| --------- | ------ |
| Astalagan | Bronze |
| Clyssavar | Gold   |
| Eldenemir | Blue   |
| Sharruth  | Red    |
| Turadaer  | Brass  |


If the characters ask the kobolds about these dragon effigies, Mek and Minn beam with pride and explain that they crafted them according to Sparkrender's instructions. The kobolds know the effigies have some part to play in Sparkrender's plans.

**Energy Bridge Anchors.** A pair of dragon statues like the ones in area D1 stands on the west side of the rotunda, and another pair stands on the southwest side. If the moonstone key is inserted in one of these statues, the western pair creates a bridge back to the overlook (area D1), and the southwestern pair creates a bridge to a crumbled and isolated tower (area D4).

# D3: KOBOLD CAMP

A rickety bridge made of driftwood and rope spans the 15-foot gap between the rotunda (area D2) and this structure.

> Skittering sounds and whispers come from inside this ruined tower. Gaps in the stone are patched over with wooden planks and threadbare cloth.

Three **kobolds** (Ekrash, Erp, and Hev) and two **winged kobolds** (Nuhro and Snirke) currently inhabit this camp, polishing sling bullets and keeping busy until it's time for Sparkrender's ritual. Initially, the kobolds are hostile toward the characters, determined to scare off the intruders. They are susceptible to intimidation, though; as an action, a character can make a DC 13 Charisma (Intimidation) check, convincing them to back down on a success.


# D4: ISOLATED STUDY

No bridge spans the 22-foot gap between the rotunda and this spire, unless the characters use the moonstone key to activate the energy bridge in area D2. Characters might come up with any number of ingenious ways to cross the gap. See the sidebar called "Clever Solutions" for advice to help you determine whether these solutions work.

> The rhythm of the waves below echoes throughout this cramped tower. Part of the floor has crumbled away, dropping off into a chamber below. Amid the rubble, collapsed bookcases jut out at odd angles, and moldering books are strewn across the floor.

*Scholar's Journal.* Though most of the books have fallen apart, one tome—a small black journal with an ornate lock—remains intact. A character who examines the book and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check notices a small arcane rune engraved above the keyhole on the journal's lock. A character who casts the *detect magic* spell also sees a faint aura around the keyhole.

This rune is a magical trap that triggers if the journal is opened without the use of its original key, which is long lost. A character who makes a successful DC 11 Intelligence (Arcana) check can determine how to disarm the trap: by carefully scratching over the rune with a dagger, a sharp piece of wire, or a similar implement. Once this is done, the journal can safely be opened either by picking the lock with thieves' tools and making a successful DC 10 Dexterity check, or by breaking the lock with a successful DC 12 Strength check. If the lock is opened without first disarming the trap, the magic trap

## CLEVER SOLUTIONS

The challenges characters face in this adventure can have more than one solution. For example, to reach the isolated study (area D4), characters could try any of these approaches:

* Ask the winged kobolds to retrieve the moonstone key from area D1 so it can be used again in area D2.
* Dive or climb down into the water below, swim over to the other column, and climb back up to the study.
* Have a character use the *misty step* spell to cross the gap and explore alone.

Remember, there's more than one way to proceed through an adventure, and more than one way to play D&D! When characters come up with clever solutions to tricky problems, reward them with success—or at least a good chance of success. Use the guidelines in the "Improvising Ability Checks" section at the start of this booklet to help you. Embrace your players' creativity, and let them surprise you!

spews out noxious green gas, and the character who opened the lock takes 3 (1d6) poison damage.

Inside, the journal contains star maps and notes on experiments with magic. One passage is underlined near the start of the journal. It reads, in an archaic dialect of Common, "To ye four scholars: point your eyes toward the Dragon's light, for it guides your descent into knowledge." This passage is a clue to unlocking the hidden entrance in the observatory tower (area D5).

*Treasure.* A character who searches the tower and succeeds on a DC 12 Intelligence (Investigation) check finds a loose brick in the northwest wall. Pulling the brick out reveals a hidden compartment containing a *potion of resistance* (lightning; described in appendix A) and a pouch holding 10 gp.

# D5: OBSERVATORY TOWER

Standing taller than the rest of the observatory, the main floor of this tower is 45 feet above the ocean's surface, which puts it 15 feet above the floor of the rotunda (area D2). The kobolds have constructed a rough pulley lift so the wingless kobolds can reach this area when Sparkrender summons them.

> Rays of light dance across the remains of this tower's stained glass dome, making iridescent colors shimmer across the crumbled marble walls. Gilded lines and jeweled inlays form a detailed star map spanning the dusty floor. Four alabaster statues of scholars stand around the perimeter of the room, their expressions worn with time. Each ten-foot-tall statue is pointing or gesturing in a different direction.
>
> Curled in the northeast corner of the tower is a lithe blue dragon. Lightning arcs around his horns and snout as he slumbers amid a scattered collection of coins and glittering jewels.

Sparkrender the **blue dragon wyrmling** is currently sleeping here, curled up against the northeast wall. This presents the characters with an important choice: they can awaken the dragon and fight him now, or they can sneak past the dragon, find a way into the secret library below (area D6) and free Aidron, and then fight Sparkrender with Aidron's help. Either approach is fine. The fight will be easier for the characters with Aidron on their side, but they can still triumph without Aidron's help.

You don't need to encourage one course of action or the other. Make sure the players realize they have a choice, though. You can use Mek and Minn (the kobolds from D2) to remind the characters there's another dragon around. As you describe the observatory tower, you can also highlight the caved-in wall beneath it (leading to area D6) as a potential


point of access to the tower. Or you can just tell the players they have these two options—plus any others they come up with on their own!

**Sneaking Around.** If the characters move quietly around the area, they can avoid waking Sparkrender as long as at least half of them succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity (Stealth) check.

If the characters try to turn the statues (see "Hidden Entrance" below) without waking Sparkrender, have the characters turning the north and east statues (nearest the sleeping dragon) each make a DC 14 Dexterity (Stealth) check. On a failed check, the noise of a turning statue wakes the dragon.

**Waking the Dragon.** If awakened, Sparkrender is hostile toward the characters, growling and barking threats in Draconic. Characters who speak Draconic (the paladin and the wizard) can try to convince the dragon not to attack by making a DC 12 Charisma check and applying the Deception, Intimidation, or Persuasion skill as appropriate. A character who succeeds on the check stops Sparkrender from attacking immediately, and he instead takes the opportunity to boast about his grand ambitions. If no character successfully intervenes, or if a character mentions Aidron or Runara, Sparkrender snarls and attacks.

Despite his youth, Sparkrender is a fearsome foe and a loathsome villain. He uses Breath Weapon on his first turn and every round it is available thereafter. (Clever characters can try to use the statues for cover from the dragon's breath; see "Cover" in the rulebook.) Consider having the wyrmling deliver short lines of dialogue on each of his turns, inspired by the following examples:

- "You pests will not stand in my way! I will claim the might of my ancestors!"
- "Get out of here before I tire of this game and end you all!"
- "Chromatic dragons are the rightful rulers of this world. Bow down to the children of Tiamat!"
- "Enough of this! This work is too important to be hindered by the likes of you!"

The dragon fights until reduced to 10 or fewer hit points, at which point he swears vengeance against the characters and attempts to flee the island starting on his next turn. (He might say something like this as he takes the Disengage action and flies away: "I swear by Eldenemir the Raging Storm and the five heads of Tiamat, you will pay for this insult!")

If the characters flee, Sparkrender does not pursue them, but he taunts them as they run away. (He might say something like, "Yes! Flee before my might, as all will flee when I claim my inheritance!")

If the characters defeat Sparkrender, they hear growling and yelping coming from below them (area D6).

**Hidden Entrance.** Each of the four statues can be rotated on its base. To unlock the hidden entrance to the observatory's secret archive, each statue must be rotated so it points at the constellation called the Dragon of Dawn on the floor's star map.

If the characters found the clue in the isolated study (area D4) exhorting "four scholars" to "point your eyes toward the Dragon's light," they might search the star map for a constellation that looks like a dragon. A character who searches the floor and succeeds on a DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation) check finds a constellation resembling a dragon in the southeast quadrant of the floor.

In lieu of that information, a character who searches the room for clues and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check notices worn grooves in the base of each statue, suggesting the statues can turn on their bases. While turning a statue, a character can make a DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check; if the check succeeds, the character notices the statue settles slightly when it is pointing toward the southeast quadrant of the room and requires extra effort to nudge out of that position.

Once each statue is in its correct position, a semicircular section at the center of the floor begins to glow before descending into the library (area D6). It forms a spiral staircase leading down to the floor of the library. When any statue is rotated out of its position, the staircase rises back up, sealing the library shut once more. (A character on the staircase when this happens is lifted up to this area on the rising stairs.)

**Treasure.** With Sparkrender no longer defending his fledgling hoard, characters can gather it up. It includes large piles of coins: 4,500 cp, 2,200 sp, and 130 gp. There are also ten gems: five pale blue quartz crystals worth 10 gp each and five blue jasper stones worth 50 gp each. A waterproof leather case holds a blue silk fan painted with powdered blue gems, worth 25 gp. There are also a few ordinary items Sparkrender enjoyed, including a crude flute with a pleasing sound, an hourglass filled with sparkling sand, and a set of seven candlesticks.

## D6: SECRET LIBRARY

This space was formerly a hidden archive of knowledge, accessible only to those who knew the observatory's secrets. However, the walls of the tower are crumbling—a fact that Sparkrender used to trap Aidron here. After weakening the bronze wyrmling, Sparkrender forced him into the library and then caused one of the walls to cave in, sealing the exit.

If the characters don't use the hidden entrance in area D5, they can attempt to clear away the rubble from the cave-in to access the secret library. To access the rubble, the characters must climb down from area D5 or swim to the bottom of this spire


and climb up from the water. Clearing the rubble takes one character 30 minutes, or the characters can work together to clear it faster (for example, it takes two characters 15 minutes or five characters 6 minutes). If the characters are trying to clear the rubble quietly, it takes twice as long, and at least half of the characters must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity (Stealth) check to avoid waking Sparkrender.

Once they've cleared the rubble, the characters can access the library's interior.

> Stale air heavy with the smell of old parchment floods your nostrils. The walls are lined with shelves stuffed full of old tomes and yellowing scrolls. Glass cases, toppled over and shattered, have strewn their contents across the stone floor. The sound of splintering wood echoes through the space, and a moment later you see an agitated bronze dragon the size of a bear, picking himself up from the wreckage of the old desk he apparently crashed into.

Aidron the **bronze dragon wyrmling** excitedly greets the characters when they enter. He has spent days trying to dig his way out through the caved-in wall, but his efforts from the inside only caused further collapse. He is eager to escape, but if the characters ask, he explains his conflict with Sparkrender. He expresses regret over his inability to defeat the blue wyrmling and concern for the safety of the island's other inhabitants. And he is terrified of the fate Sparkrender has in store for him—the blue dragon plans to use Aidron's death to claim the power of all the dead dragons on the island, transforming himself into a mighty draconic avatar.

If the characters have not yet defeated Sparkrender, Aidron decides to face the blue dragon himself. He flies to the top of the observatory tower (area D5) to confront Sparkrender once more. However, Aidron is too weak to defeat Sparkrender alone; he needs the characters' help.

Once Sparkrender is defeated, the bronze wyrmling is excited to return to Dragon's Rest with the characters.

*Treasure.* This library was once a repository of magical knowledge and items of power, though most of its contents are too weathered to read. However, a character who searches through the room and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check finds a *+1 battleaxe* or a *spell scroll of hold person* (*+1 weapons* and *spell scrolls* are both described in appendix A). A *detect magic* spell reveals the location of both of these items without requiring an ability check. Aidron has also cataloged the contents of the room and can direct the characters to these valuable items.

# Sparkrender's Ritual

If the characters leave the observatory without defeating Sparkrender, they might return to find the blue wyrmling's ritual underway. This is most likely to happen if the characters leave and take a long rest before confronting Sparkrender, or if they flee from combat with Sparkrender and return after they've rested.

Another possibility is that the characters drive Sparkrender away from the island without killing him, but leave Aidron imprisoned in area D6. In this case, Runara urges the characters to return to the observatory to find Aidron. When they arrive, Sparkrender has also rested, healed, and returned to finish his work.

In either case, the characters arrive just as Sparkrender's ritual is getting underway. (If they took or destroyed the dragon effigies in area D2, they have been replaced by even cruder versions created in a hurry.) Read the following text:

> Streams of colored light swirl through the air around the golden statue in the ruined rotunda. Each shimmering display seems to originate from one of the five dragon effigies you saw before, and the lights' colors match the colors of the effigies: red, gold, brass, blue, and bronze. A blue dragon is perched atop the sculpture, throwing his head back in pain or ecstasy as the lights surround him, and he unleashes a bolt of lightning up toward the sky. At the base of the statue, a bronze dragon is bound to the ground by three heavy chains. He looks like he's in agony.

To stop the ritual, the characters must face Sparkrender (**blue dragon wyrmling**), potentially with the help of Aidron (**bronze dragon wyrmling**), if they can free Aidron from his chains (see "Freeing Aidron" below). Any surviving kobolds and winged kobolds lurk here, but they stay out of combat if possible.

See "Waking the Dragon" in area D5 for ideas on how to play Sparkrender in this encounter. He uses Breath Weapon as the characters approach the scene (unleashing lightning into the sky), so he has to wait for this action to recharge before he can use it on the characters this time. He fights to the death—he has too much riding on the success of this ritual to abandon it now.


# Dragon Spirits

**Dragon Spirits.** At the end of each round of combat (at initiative count 0, after everyone else has acted), a random magical effect occurs, caused by the magical lights that swirl around the rotunda. These lights are manifestations of the dragon spirits Sparkrender is trying to bind to himself, but their effects are unpredictable. Roll a d10 and consult the Dragon Spirits table to see what happens.

## DRAGON SPIRITS

| d10  | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1–2  | **Astalagan's Blessing.** Aidron and the characters each regain 1d4 + 4 hit points as the bronze light surrounds them with warmth.                                                                |
| 3–4  | **Clyssavar's Flames.** Sparkrender must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or take 7 (2d6) fire damage as the red light erupts with fire.                                                 |
| 5–6  | **Eldenemir's Gift.** Sparkrender's Breath Weapon recharges as the blue light enfolds him.                                                                                                        |
| 7–8  | **Sharruth's Fury.** Each of the characters must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or take 3 (1d6) fire damage as the red light erupts with fire.                                         |
| 9–10 | **Turadaer's Tricks.** Aidron and the characters gain advantage on attack rolls and saving throws until initiative count 0 of the next round, as the brass light shimmers and sparks around them. |


**Freeing Aidron.** Aidron is bound by three heavy chains that keep him restrained. He can still take actions, such as biting or clawing an enemy that comes within his reach, but he knows Sparkrender is unaffected by his lightning Breath Weapon, so he doesn't bother using it. He might use his Repulsion Breath if he can see a good use for it.

Large clasps attach the chains to iron rings embedded in the ground. A character can use an action to undo one clasp. Once all three clasps are undone, Aidron is no longer restrained, though the chains reduce his speed by 10 feet. Removing the chains from Aidron takes 10 minutes.

**Disrupting the Ritual.** The most straightforward way to prevent Sparkrender from completing his ritual and obtaining the power he craves is to kill him. But characters can also use their actions in combat to interfere with the process and hinder Sparkrender in magical ways. Let the players try whatever they can imagine, using these ideas as examples:

**Manipulate the Effigies.** A character might use an action to lift an effigy closer to the central sculpture, breathe a prayer to the dragon it represents, or otherwise coax magic from it. Doing so immediately triggers the corresponding effect from the Dragon Spirits Table.

**Destroy the Effigies.** A character might break an effigy or throw it over the crumbling wall and into the ocean below. This ensures the corresponding effect does not occur again. (Reroll if you get that result on the Dragon Spirits table.)

**Manipulate the Sculpture.** Characters might try to manipulate the golden sculpture as a way of disrupting the ritual. The sculpture is large and sturdy, though, so a single action has no noticeable effect on the sculpture or the magic. (The sculpture has AC 20, 27 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.) However, disturbing the sculpture does distract Sparkrender. The first time a character uses an action to attack or otherwise try to disturb the sculpture, the distracted blue dragon has disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws until the end of his next turn. Once he sees the character's meddling isn't effective, he can't be distracted in this way again.

# ENDING THE ADVENTURE

With Aidron in tow, the characters can return victorious to Dragon's Rest. Runara is pleased by the bronze wyrmling's safe return. As a reward, she gives each of the characters a *potion of healing* and an exquisite pearl worth 100 gp. She welcomes them to stay at Dragon's Rest as long as they wish and furnishes them with whatever supplies they need for their travels when they're ready to leave the island. If Sparkrender is dead, she grieves the death of yet another dragon on Stormwreck Isle, but she doesn't condemn the characters for killing him.

If your players wish to continue playing their characters, you can use the contents of this set to create your own adventures. The "Exploring the Island" section of chapter 1 offers additional encounters you can use if the characters haven't already faced them. Perhaps Sparkrender (or a relative of his) pursues the characters in search of revenge, or perhaps something uncovered in the secret library leads the characters to a distant locale in pursuit of more adventure.

If you want to advance these characters beyond 3rd level and create adventures for them, you'll need the basic rules online or the advanced rulebooks: the *Player's Handbook*, *Dungeon Master's Guide*, and *Monster Manual*.



APPENDIX A

# MAGIC ITEMS

EVERY ADVENTURE HOLDS THE PROMISE—BUT not a guarantee—of finding one or more magic items. *Dragons of Stormwreck Isle* contains an assortment of magic items that hints at the wider variety of magic items waiting to be found in the worlds of D&D.

## USING A MAGIC ITEM

A magic item's description explains how the item works. Handling a magic item is enough to give a character a sense that something is extraordinary about the item. To learn more, a character can concentrate on the item during a short rest, while being in physical contact with the item. At the end of the rest, the character learns the item's properties. Potions are an exception; a little taste is enough to tell the taster what the potion does.

## ITEM DESCRIPTIONS

These items are in alphabetical order. Under an item's name is a line that tells you the type of the item, its rarity, and whether you must attune to it.

### BOOTS OF ELVENKIND
*Wondrous Item, Uncommon*

While you wear these boots, your steps make no sound, regardless of the surface you are moving across. You also have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks that rely on moving silently.

### ELIXIR OF HEALTH
*Potion, Rare*

When you drink this potion, it cures any disease afflicting you, and it removes the blinded, deafened, paralyzed, and poisoned conditions. The clear red liquid has tiny bubbles of light in it.

[Image shows a pair of ornate green and brown boots with decorative patterns, labeled as "BOOTS OF ELVENKIND"]

### POTION OF HEALING
*Potion, Common*

You regain 2d4 + 2 hit points when you drink this potion. The potion's red liquid glimmers when agitated.

### POTION OF RESISTANCE
*Potion, Uncommon*

When you drink this potion, you gain resistance to one type of damage for 1 hour. The DM chooses the type or determines it randomly from the options below.

| d10 | Damage Type | d10 | Damage Type |
| --- | ----------- | --- | ----------- |
| 1   | Acid        | 6   | Necrotic    |
| 2   | Cold        | 7   | Poison      |
| 3   | Fire        | 8   | Psychic     |
| 4   | Force       | 9   | Radiant     |
| 5   | Lightning   | 10  | Thunder     |


### SPELL SCROLL
*Scroll, Varies*

A *spell scroll* bears the words of a single spell, written in a mystical cipher. If the spell is on your class's spell list, you can read the scroll and cast its spell without providing any material components. Otherwise, the scroll is unintelligible. Casting the spell by reading the scroll requires the spell's normal casting time. Once the spell is cast, the words on the scroll fade, and it crumbles to dust. If the casting is interrupted, the scroll is not lost.

If the spell is on your class's spell list but of a higher level than you can normally cast, you must make an ability check using your spellcasting ability to determine whether you cast it successfully. The DC equals 10 + the spell's level. On a success, you cast the spell; on a failure, the spell disappears from the scroll with no other effect.

The level of the spell on the scroll determines the spell's saving throw DC and attack bonus, as well as the scroll's rarity, as shown in the Spell Scroll table.

#### SPELL SCROLL

| Spell Level | Rarity   | Save DC | Attack Bonus |
| ----------- | -------- | ------- | ------------ |
| Cantrip     | Common   | 13      | +5           |
| 1st         | Common   | 13      | +5           |
| 2nd         | Uncommon | 13      | +5           |


### WEAPON, +1
*Weapon (Any), Uncommon*

You have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

APPENDIX B

# CREATURES

THIS APPENDIX CONTAINS STAT BLOCKS AND SHORT descriptions for the creatures that appear in *Dragons of Stormwreck Isle*.

## CREATURE STAT BLOCKS

A creature's stat block provides the essential information that you, as the DM, need to run it. The following sections explain the various pieces of information you'll find in a stat block.

### SIZE

A stat block tells you a creature's size: Tiny, Small, Medium, Large, Huge, or Gargantuan. Size is explained in the rulebook.

### SQUEEZING INTO A SMALLER SPACE

A creature can squeeze through a space large enough for a creature one size smaller than itself. When a creature is squeezing through such a space, its speed is halved, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and Dexterity saving throws, and attack rolls against it have advantage.

### TYPE

A creature's type is specified in a stat block, indicating the family of creatures that it belongs to. The types in the game are Aberration, Beast, Celestial, Construct, Dragon, Elemental, Fey, Fiend, Giant, Humanoid, Monstrosity, Ooze, Plant, and Undead.

### ALIGNMENT

A creature's alignment reflects its disposition. See the rulebook for descriptions of the different alignments.

### ARMOR CLASS

A creature that wears armor or carries a shield has an AC that takes its armor, shield, and Dexterity into account. Otherwise, a creature's AC is based on its Dexterity modifier and any natural armor or supernatural resilience it might possess.

If a creature wears armor or carries a shield, the kind of armor it wears or shield it carries is noted in parentheses after its AC value.

### HIT POINTS

A stat block specifies a creature's hit point maximum. In parentheses, the stat block also indicates the Hit Dice that were rolled to determine those hit points, plus the creature's Constitution modifier multiplied by the number of Hit Dice.

### SPEED

A creature's speed tells you how far it can move on its turn. For more information on speed, see the rulebook.

All creatures have a walking speed; those that have no form of ground-based locomotion have a walking speed of 0 feet. Some of the creatures in this adventure have one or more additional movement modes:

**Burrow.** A creature that has a burrowing speed can use all or part of its movement to move through sand, earth, mud, or ice. It can't burrow through solid rock unless it has a special trait that allows it to do so.

**Fly.** A creature that has a flying speed can use all or part of its movement to fly. If the creature is incapacitated or knocked prone while flying, it falls unless it can hover.

**Swim.** A creature that has a swimming speed doesn't need to spend extra movement to swim.

### ABILITY SCORES

Every creature has six ability scores (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma) and corresponding modifiers. For more information on ability scores, see the rulebook.

### SAVING THROWS

The Saving Throws entry is reserved for creatures that are proficient in one or more saving throws.

Saving throws in a stat block are shown with the total modifier—the creature's ability modifier plus its proficiency bonus. If a creature's stat block says "Con +4," roll a d20 and add 4 when the creature makes a saving throw using Constitution.

### SKILLS

The Skills entry is reserved for creatures that are proficient in one or more skills.

Skills in a stat block are shown with the total modifier—the creature's ability modifier plus its proficiency bonus. If a creature's stat block says "Stealth +4," roll a d20 and add 4 when the creature makes an ability check using Stealth.

### VULNERABILITIES, RESISTANCES, AND IMMUNITIES

Some creatures have vulnerability, resistance, or immunity to certain types of damage. Additionally, some creatures are immune to certain conditions. These immunities are also noted here.


# SENSES

The Senses entry gives a creature's passive Wisdom (Perception) score, as well as any special senses the creature has, such as the following:

**Blindsight.** A creature with blindsight can perceive its surroundings without having to rely on sight, within a specific radius.

**Darkvision.** A creature with darkvision can see in dim light within the radius as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light. The creature discerns color in darkness as shades of gray.

# LANGUAGES

The languages that a creature can speak are listed in alphabetical order.

# CHALLENGE

A well-rested party of four adventurers should be able to defeat a creature that has a challenge rating equal to the adventurers' level without any characters dying. Creatures weaker than 1st-level characters have challenge ratings lower than 1.

# TRAITS

In a stat block, traits are special features that appear right under the creature's Challenge entry.

# ACTIONS

When a creature takes its action, it can choose from the options in the "Actions" section of its stat block and the options in the rulebook.

# MELEE AND RANGED ATTACKS

The most common actions that a creature takes in combat are melee and ranged attacks. See the rulebook for how attacks work.

Any damage or other effects that occur as a result of an attack hitting a target are described here. As the DM, you can use the average damage or roll the damage; for this reason, both the average damage and the die expression are presented. For example, if a monster deals 4 (1d8) slashing damage with its longsword, that notation means you can have the monster deal 4 damage, or you can roll 1d8 to determine the damage.

# LIMITED USAGE

Some special abilities—whether they are traits, actions, or reactions—have restrictions on the number of times they can be used:

**X/Day.** The notation "X/Day" means a special ability can be used a certain number of times, and then the creature must finish a long rest to regain expended uses. For example, "1/Day" means a special ability can be used once, and then the creature must finish a long rest to use it again.

**Recharge X–Y.** The notation "Recharge X–Y" means a creature can use a special ability once, and then the ability has a random chance of recharging during each subsequent round of combat. At the start of each of the creature's turns, roll a d6. If the roll is one of the numbers in the recharge notation, the creature regains the use of that special ability. The ability also recharges when the creature finishes a short or long rest. For example, "Recharge 5–6" means a creature can use the special ability once. Then, at the start of the creature's turn each round, it regains the use of the ability if it rolls a 5 or 6 on a d6.


# CREATURE DESCRIPTIONS

The creatures that appear in the adventure are presented in this section in alphabetical order.

## DRAGONS

Dragons are winged reptiles of ancient lineage and fearsome power. The oldest dragons, over a thousand years old, are some of the most powerful creatures in the world. Dragons' innate magic fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural abilities.

The chromatic and metallic dragon families encompass most of dragonkind. The chromatic dragons—black, blue, green, red, and white—are largely selfish, evil, and feared. The metallic dragons—brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver—are typically noble, good, and respected by the wise.

Though their goals and ideals vary tremendously, most dragons covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and magic items.

Chromatic and metallic dragons pass through four distinct stages of life, from wyrmlings to ancient dragons. Even wyrmlings in their first five years of life are fearsome threats, and wise adventurers do not underestimate them or dismiss them as "children."

## BLUE DRAGONS

Vain and territorial, many blue dragons take pleasure in lording their power over creatures they see as lesser.

BRONZE DRAGON WYRMLING

# BRONZE DRAGONS

Many bronze dragons are friendly coastal dwellers who enjoy watching ships and sailors.

*Runara.* Despite her innocuous disguise and her commitment to peace, the leader of Dragon's Rest is an adult bronze dragon—a fearsome opponent or a powerful ally. Her capabilities go beyond what is presented here.

# HARPY

The cruel harpy uses its sweet song to lure adventurers and sailors to their deaths. A harpy has the body, legs, and wings of a vulture but the torso, arms, and head of a human.

Every Humanoid and Giant within 300 feet of the harpy that can hear the song must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed until the song ends. The harpy must take a bonus action on its subsequent turns to continue singing. It can stop singing at any time. The song ends if the harpy is incapacitated.

While charmed by the harpy, a target is incapacitated and ignores the songs of other harpies. If the charmed target is more than 5 feet away from the harpy, the target must move on its turn toward the harpy by the most direct route, trying to get within 5 feet. It doesn't avoid opportunity attacks, but before moving into damaging terrain, such as lava or a pit, and whenever it takes damage from a source other than the harpy, the target can repeat the saving throw. A charmed target can also repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If the saving throw is successful, the effect ends on it.

A target that succeeds on its saving throw is immune to this harpy's song for the next 24 hours.

# SPORE SERVANT OCTOPUS

Spore servants are dead creatures reanimated by the magical spores of a myconid leader. The final act of the myconid leader in Seagrow Caves before lapsing into its current comatose state was creating a spore servant from a dead giant octopus to protect the caves while the leader slept. Unlike a living octopus, this guardian has only basic control over its tentacles. Rather than coiling around intruders to immobilize them, the spore servant simply bludgeons them.

## PROFICIENCIES

You have the following proficiencies. The rulebook explains what proficiency means.

**Saving Throws.** Your saving throw proficiencies are indicated by a ● in the Saving Throws list on the left.

**Skills.** Your skill proficiencies are indicated by a ● in the Skills list on the left.

**Equipment.** You have proficiency with daggers, darts, light crossbows, longswords, quarterstaffs, shortbows, shortswords, and slings.

## LANGUAGES

You can speak, read, and write Common, Celestial, Draconic, Dwarfish, and Elvish.

## ATTACKS

Your spells are your best tool in combat, but you also have a weapon you can use.

**Shortsword.** In melee (against a target within 5 feet of you), you can attack with your shortsword. Roll **1d20 + 4** to see if you hit. If you do, the target takes **1d6 + 2** piercing damage.

## WIZARD

Wizards are studious magic-users who wield spells fueled by the magic that permeates the cosmos. The lure of knowledge calls wizards out of the safety of their libraries into crumbling ruins and lost cities.

The wizard class gives you the following features.

**Spellbook.** You have a spellbook containing these 1st-level spells, each of which is detailed in the rulebook:

| detect magic<br/>mage armor<br/>magic missile | shield<br/>sleep<br/>thunderwave |
| --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |


**Prepared Spells.** Whenever you finish a long rest, you can prepare 1st-level spells to make them available for you to cast, choosing from the spells in your spellbook. Write your prepared spells here:

___________________ ___________________

___________________ ___________________

___________________ ___________________

**Spell Slots.** You have two 1st-level spell slots you can use to cast your prepared spells. You can use them to cast two different spells or to cast the same spell twice. You regain your expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

You can keep track of your expended spell slots by checking them off in the Spellcasting table on this sheet's other side, where each spell slot is represented by a checkbox.

**Cantrips.** You know a few cantrips, which are spells you can cast without expending spell slots. You know the following cantrips, each of which is detailed in the rulebook:

| *mage hand<br/>prestidigitation* | *ray of frost<br/>shocking grasp* |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |


**Spell Attacks and Saving Throws.** When a creature makes a saving throw to resist one of your spells, the DC of the saving throw is 13. When you make a spell attack, you roll **1d20 + 5** to see if you hit. These numbers are based on your spellcasting ability, which is Intelligence.

**Spell save DC = 13**
**Spell attack roll = 1d20 + 5**

**Ritual Casting.** You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don't need to have the spell prepared. The rulebook explains rituals.

**Arcane Recovery.** You can regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook. Once per day during a short rest, you can recover one 1st-level spell slot.

# HIGH ELF

Elves are a people of otherworldly grace, long-lived and passionate. In the earliest days of the multiverse, the first high elves settled in fey crossings, places where the natural world and a fantastic realm of magic and emotion, known as the Feywild, touch and overlap. The high elves mystically took on characteristics blending both realms. Your facility with language and your innate understanding of useful magic are part of that mystical adaptation.

As a high elf, you have the following traits.

**Darkvision.** You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light and in darkness in that radius as if it were dim light. You discern colors in that darkness only as shades of gray.

**Fey Ancestry.** You have advantage on saving throws you make to avoid or end the charmed condition on yourself.

**Trance.** Elves don't need to sleep, and magic can't put you to sleep. You can finish a long rest in 4 hours if you spend those hours in a trancelike meditation, during which you retain consciousness.

**Cantrip.** Your prestidigitation cantrip (listed above) reflects the innate magic of a high elf, not your wizardly study.

## YOUR SAGE BACKGROUND

Your parents identified your magical talent early in your long elven life and arranged for you to be apprenticed to a kindly wizard in the city of Neverwinter. You excelled at your studies and forged friendships and rivalries with other apprentices. You always had a particular knack for wielding flashy, energetic forces, and you focused your study on the school of evocation.

Your background shaped your character in some important ways. A secret sought by a colleague drives you. Your skill proficiencies in Arcana and History also reflect your upbringing, studying the nature of magic of the great wizards of days past who wielded it.

After graduating from your apprenticeship, you and your peers went your separate ways to focus on your own studies. Recently, you received a letter from one of your colleagues, pointing you toward a source of lost knowledge. Shortly after the letter arrived, you learned tragic news: your friend died under mysterious circumstances.

**Personal Goal: Discover Lost Knowledge.** The letter spoke of an arcane observatory built on a nearby island by wizards long gone, and it hinted at powerful magic hidden there. A small cloister known as Dragon's Rest also resides on the island. The caretaker of the cloister's temple to the dragon god Bahamut, who is a patron of heroes and a champion of justice, must have information regarding the observatory. This Elder Runara can set you on the path to discovering the knowledge your friend never found.

## MAKING THE CHARACTER YOURS

Follow these steps to make this character uniquely yours:

1. Choose a name and write it in the "Character Name" space on the front of this sheet. Your character's name can be anything you like, perhaps drawing from a real-world culture or a work of literature.
2. Decide what you look like and determine your character's gender. You decide your character's height, weight, age, and coloration (eyes, hair, and skin). You can use the art on this page for inspiration or choose your own direction. You also might want to give your character a memorable physical characteristic, such as a scar, a limp, spectacles, or a tattoo.
3. Flesh out your character's personality, and read about your character's alignment in the rulebook (you may choose a different alignment from among the options there). The goal is to choose traits and mannerisms for your character that you'll enjoy.

## GAINING LEVELS

The DM will tell you when you reach 2nd level and then 3rd level. When you reach a new level, you gain the features below for that level.

## HIT DICE AND HIT POINTS

With each level you gain, you gain one additional Hit Die (d6), which you can use to heal yourself when you take a short rest (explained in the rulebook). When you level up, add the new Hit Die to the Hit Dice box on this sheet, and add 1d6 + 2 to your hit point maximum.

## SPELLCASTING ADVANCEMENT

You gain access to more spells as you gain levels. You can prepare a number of spells equal to your wizard level + your Intelligence modifier, as shown in the Spellcasting table. You also gain more spell slots.

## SPELLCASTING

| Wizard Level | Prepared Spells | 1st-Level Slots | 2nd-Level Slots |
| ------------ | --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| 1st          | 4               | □□              | —               |
| 2nd          | 5               | □□□             | —               |
| 3rd          | 6               | □□□□            | □□              |


**Adding Spells to Your Spellbook.** Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook, chosen from the wizard spell list below. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. On your adventures, you might also find scrolls or books containing other spells you can add to your spellbook.

**Copying a Spell into the Book.** When you find a wizard spell, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a level for which you have spell slots and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.

For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and requires 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell when you can otherwise do so.

## 2ND-LEVEL FEATURES

**Evocation Savant.** The gold and time you must spend to copy an evocation spell into your spellbook is halved.

**Sculpt Spells.** When you cast an evocation spell that affects other creatures you can see, you can choose a number of them equal to 1 + the spell's level. The chosen creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws against the spell, and they take no damage if they would normally take half damage from it.

## 3RD-LEVEL FEATURES

**Arcane Recovery.** You can now recover two 1st-level spell slots, or a single 2nd-level spell slot (your choice).

**Spells.** You can now prepare and cast 2nd-level spells.

## WIZARD SPELL LIST

- Comprehend languages (ritual)
- Detect magic (ritual)
- Mage armor

- Protection from evil and good
- Ray of sickness
- Shield
- Sleep

# PROFICIENCIES

You have the following proficiencies. The rulebook explains what proficiency means.

**Saving Throws.** Your saving throw proficiencies are indicated by a ● in the Saving Throws list on the left.

**Skills.** Your skill proficiencies are indicated by a ● in the Skills list on the left.

**Equipment.** You have proficiency with light armor, simple weapons, hand crossbows, longswords, rapiers, and shortswords. You also have proficiency with thieves' tools.

# LANGUAGES

You can speak, read, and write Common, Goblin, and Halfling.

# ATTACKS

You start with the following weapons, which you can use to make attacks.

**Dagger.** In melee (against a target within 5 feet of you), you can attack with your dagger. You can also throw a dagger at a target up to 20 feet away, or up to 60 feet away with disadvantage on the attack roll. In either case, roll **1d20 + 5** to see if you hit. If you do, the target takes **1d4 + 3 piercing damage**.

**Shortbow.** You can shoot your shortbow at a target up to 80 feet away, or up to 320 feet with disadvantage on the attack roll. Roll **1d20 + 5** to see if you hit. If you do, the target takes **1d6 + 3 piercing damage**.

# ROGUE

Rogues develop broad expertise that few other characters can match. When it comes to battle, rogues prioritize cunning over brute strength, placing one precise strike exactly where the attack will hurt the most.

The rogue class gives you the following features.

*Expertise.* Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses the Stealth skill (which is already included on your Skills list) or your proficiency with thieves' tools.

*Sneak Attack.* Once per turn, when you hit a creature with a Dexterity-based attack (such as with your dagger or shortbow) and you have advantage on the attack roll, you can deal an extra **1d6 damage** to your target. You don't need advantage on the attack if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it and isn't incapacitated. You can't deal this extra damage, however, if you have disadvantage on the attack roll.

*Thieves' Cant.* You know thieves' cant, a secret mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to hide messages in seemingly normal conversation. You also understand a set of secret signs and symbols used to convey short, simple, messages.

# LIGHTFOOT HALFLING

Halflings are small folk, but they are also blessed with luck and courage befitting the mightiest of dragons. Lightfoot halflings easily hide from notice, slipping around and behind bigger folk as they fiend or foe.

As a lightfoot halfling, you have the following traits.

*Lucky.* When you roll a 1 on the d20 for an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you can reroll the d20 and must use the new roll.

*Brave.* You have advantage on saving throws you make to avoid or remove the frightened condition on yourself.

*Halfling Nimbleness.* You can move through the space of any creature that is of a size larger than yours.

*Naturally Stealthy.* You can attempt to hide when you are obscured by a creature that is at least one size larger than you.

# YOUR CRIMINAL BACKGROUND

You fell in with a thieves' guild called the Gilded Gallow's at an early age. The guild has prospered in recent years, and its influence is spreading across the Sword Coast. You followed that expansion, hoping to find your fortune in the city of Neverwinter.

Your background shaped your character in important ways. You learned the use of thieves' tools from scoundrels and gamblers (shown in "Proficiencies" on the front of this sheet) and picked up the Goblin language at the same time. Your skill proficiencies in Deception and Stealth also reflect your upbringing, talking your way out of trouble and skulking past unfriendly eyes.

**Fortunes in Neverwinter** have been fair but not the fast riches you hoped for. You heard a story from a smuggler about a high-ranking member of the Gilded Gallow's who turned traitor, killed their partner, and fled with a sovereign's ransom in treasure. Thanks to details you've picked up here and there that corroborate the story, you're certain it's more than just a rumor.

**Personal Goal: Find the Lost Fortune.** Whoever that Gilder was who skipped out with the gold, they've covered their tracks well. The trail went cold in Neverwinter, but recently you've learned of a remote island cloister called Dragon's Rest. The cloister holds a temple to the dragon god Bahamut, who is a patron of heroes and a champion of justice. There is also a community of hermits who live there now, the perfect place to hide for someone wishing to escape their past. If that treasure's there, you'll find it.

# MAKING THE CHARACTER YOURS

Follow these steps to make this character uniquely yours:

1. Choose a name and write it in the "Character Name" space on the front of this sheet. Your character's name can be anything you like, perhaps drawing from a real-world culture or a work of literature.

2. Decide what you look like and determine your character's gender. You decide your character's height, weight, age, and coloration (eyes, hair, and skin). You can use the art on this page for inspiration or choose your own direction. You also might want to give your character a memorable physical characteristic, such as a scar, a limp, spectacles, or a tattoo. You can write notes about your character's appearance in the "Notes" space below.

3. Flesh out your character's personality, and read about your character's alignment in the rulebook (you may choose a different alignment from among the options there). The goal is to choose traits and mannerisms for your character that you'll enjoy.

# GAINING LEVELS

The DM will tell you when you reach 2nd level and then 3rd level. When you reach a new level, you gain the features below for that level.

# HIT DICE AND HIT POINTS

With each level you gain, you gain one additional Hit Die (d8), which you can use to heal yourself when you take a short rest (explained in the rulebook). When you level up, add the new Hit Die to the Hit Dice box on this sheet, and add 1d8 +1 to your hit point maximum.

## 2ND-LEVEL FEATURE

**Cunning Action.** Your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly, so you can take a bonus action on each of your turns in combat. This action can be used only to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action.

## 3RD-LEVEL FEATURES

**Second-Story Work.** You gain the ability to climb faster than normal, so climbing no longer costs you extra movement. In addition, when you make a running jump, the distance you can cover increases by a number of feet equal to your Dexterity modifier.

**Fast Hands.** You can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check, take the Use an Object action, or use your thieves' tools to try to disarm a trap or open a lock.

**Sneak Attack.** You deal 2d6 damage with your Sneak Attack, instead of 1d6.

**EQUIPMENT**

## PROFICIENCIES

You have the following proficiencies. The rulebook explains what proficiency means.

**Saving Throws.** Your saving throw proficiencies are indicated by a ● in the Saving Throws list on the left.

**Skills.** Your skill proficiencies are indicated by a ● in the Skills list on the left.

**Equipment.** You have proficiency with all armor, shields, simple weapons, and martial weapons.

## LANGUAGES

You can speak, read, and write Common, Draconic, Dwarvish, and Giant.

## ATTACKS

You start with the following weapons, which you can use to make attacks.

**Battleaxe.** In melee (against a target within 5 feet of you), you can attack with your battleaxe. Roll 1d20 + 5 to see if you hit. If you do, the target takes 1d8 + 3 slashing damage, or 1d10 + 3 slashing damage if you wield the battleaxe with two hands (which means dropping your shield).

**Javelin.** In melee (against a target within 5 feet of you), you can attack with a javelin. You can also throw a javelin at a target up to 30 feet away, or up to 120 feet away with disadvantage on the attack roll. In either case, roll 1d20 + 5 to see if you hit. If you do, the target takes 1d6 + 3 piercing damage.

## PALADIN

Paladins swear oaths to gods, ancient orders, and great causes. A paladin's oath is a powerful bond that turns a devout warrior into a blessed champion. You swore your oath to the god Bahamut, the Platinum Dragon, who is a patron of heroes and a champion of justice.

The paladin class gives you the following features.

**Divine Sense.** As an action, you can open your senses to the presence of strong evil and powerful good. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any Celestial, Fiend, or Undead within 60 feet of you that is not behind total cover. You also know the type of any being whose presence you sense. Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated.

**Lay on Hands.** Your blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool of healing power that replenishes when you take a long rest. With that pool, you can restore a total of 5 hit points.

As an action, you can touch a creature and draw power from the pool to restore a number of hit points to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in your pool.

Alternatively, you can expend 5 hit points from your pool of healing to cure the target of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting it. You can cure multiple diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a single use of Lay on Hands, expending hit point separately for each one.

This feature has no effect on Undead or Constructs.

## ABOUT HUMANS

Humans are the most numerous people of the Forgotten Realms. They live alongside elves, dwarves, halflings, and other peoples in villages, towns, and cities across the world. Human adventurers are often motivated to leave a lasting legacy.

# YOUR NOBLE BACKGROUND

Your family is no stranger to wealth, power, and privilege. In the glory days of Neverwinter, your parents ruled the county of Corlinn Hill, located in the hills northeast of the city. But Mount Hotenow erupted thirty years ago, devastating Neverwinter and erasing Corlinn Hill. Instead of growing up on an estate, you were raised in a small townhouse in Waterdeep. As an adult, you stand to inherit only a title.

Your background shaped your character. You learned the languages of dwarves and giants from a childhood tutor (shown in "Languages" on the front of this sheet), and your skill proficiencies in History and Persuasion reflect your education in history and etiquette.

Since swearing your oath to Bahamut, you've returned to Neverwinter and have been a champion to those who are overlooked by the institutions that exist to protect them. Recently, your resolve has been shaken by corruption in the city guard and ruling aristocrats.

**Personal Goal: Rejuvenating Pilgrimage.** Seeking to reinvigorate your resolve, you learned of a remote cloister, Dragon's Rest, on a tiny island. The cloister holds a temple to the dragon god Bahamut. You feel drawn to contemplate your place in the world there.

# MAKING THE CHARACTER YOURS

Follow these steps to make this character uniquely yours:

1. Choose a name and write it in the "Character Name" space on the front of this sheet. Your character's name can be anything you like, perhaps drawing from a real-world culture or a work of literature.

2. Decide what you look like and determine your character's gender. You can describe your character's height, weight, age, and coloration (eyes, hair, and skin). You can use the art on this page for inspiration or choose your own direction. You also might want to give your character a memorable physical characteristic, such as a scar, a limp, spectacles, or a tattoo.

3. Flesh out your character's personality, and read about your character's alignment in the rulebook (you may choose a different alignment from among the options there). The goal is to choose traits and mannerisms for your character that you'll enjoy.

# GAINING LEVELS

The DM will tell you when you reach 2nd level and then 3rd level. When you reach a new level, you gain the features below for that level.

## HIT DICE AND HIT POINTS

With each level you gain, you gain one additional Hit Die (d10), which you can use to heal yourself when you take a short rest (explained in the rulebook). When you level up, add the new Hit Die to the Hit Dice box on this sheet, and add 1d10 + 2 to your hit point maximum.

# 2ND-LEVEL FEATURES

**Prepared Spells.** Each time you finish a long rest, you can prepare three 1st-level spells to make them available for you to cast, choosing from the 1st-level spells listed below. Write your prepared spells here:

___________________ ___________________

___________________

**Spell Slots.** You have two 1st-level spell slots you can use to cast your prepared spells. You can use them to cast two different spells or to cast the same spell twice. You regain your expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. You can keep track of your expended spell slots by checking them off in the Spellcasting table, where each spell slot is represented by a checkbox.

## SPELLCASTING

| Paladin Level | Prepared Spells | 1st-Level Slots |
| ------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| 2nd           | 3               | ☐☐              |
| 3rd           | 3               | ☐☐☐             |


**Spell Attacks and Saving Throws.** When a creature makes a saving throw to resist one of your spells, the DC of the saving throw is **12**. When you make a spell attack, you roll **1d20 + 4** to see if you hit. These numbers are based on your spellcasting ability, which is Charisma.

**Spell save DC = 12**
**Spell attack roll = 1d20 + 4**

*Fighting Style: Protection.* When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding a shield.

*Divine Smite.* When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one spell slot to deal **2d8** radiant damage to the target, in addition to the weapon's damage. The extra damage increases by **1d8** if the target is an Undead or a Fiend.

*Lay on Hands.* The healing pool of Lay on Hands increases to 10.

# 3RD-LEVEL FEATURES

*Divine Health.* The divine magic flowing through you makes you immune to disease.

*Lay on Hands.* The healing pool of Lay on Hands increases to 15.

*Spells.* You gain a spell slot, as shown in the Spellcasting table. In addition to the spells you choose to prepare, you always have two extra spells prepared: *protection from evil and good* and *sanctuary*.

*Channel Divinity.* You can channel divine magic from your oath, fueling one of two effects: Sacred Weapon or Turn the Unholy. When you use Channel Divinity, choose which of these effects to create; you must then finish a short or long rest to use Channel Divinity again:

**Sacred Weapon.** As an action, you present your holy symbol and imbue one weapon that you are holding with positive energy. For 1 minute, you add +2 to attack rolls made with that weapon. The weapon also emits bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for 20 feet beyond that. If the weapon is not already magical, it becomes magical for the duration. You can end this effect on your turn as part of any other action. If you are no longer holding or carrying this weapon, or if you fall unconscious, this effect ends.

**Turn the Unholy.** As an action, you present your holy symbol, and each Fiend or Undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or be turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly ends its move in a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If it has nowhere it can move, the creature can use the Dodge action.

## PROFICIENCIES

You have the following proficiencies. The rulebook explains what proficiency means.

**Saving Throws.** Your saving throw proficiencies are indicated by a ● in the Saving Throws list on the left.

**Skills.** Your skill proficiencies are indicated by a ● in the Skills list on the left.

**Equipment.** You have proficiency with all armor, shields, simple weapons, and martial weapons.

## LANGUAGES

You can speak, read, and write Common, Dwarvish, Elvish, and Halfling.

## ATTACKS

You start with the following weapons, which you can use to make attacks.

**Greatsword.** In melee (against a target within 5 feet of you), you can attack with your greatsword. Roll 1d20 + 3 to see if you hit. If you do, the target takes 2d6 + 1 slashing damage.

**Longbow.** You can shoot your longbow at a target up to 150 feet away, or up to 600 feet with disadvantage on the attack roll. Roll 1d20 + 7 to see if you hit. If you do, the target takes 1d8 + 3 piercing damage.

## FIGHTER

Fighters are masters of martial combat, skilled with a variety of weapons and armor. They learn the basics of all combat styles and specialize in one favored form (in your case, archery). The combination of broad general ability and specialization makes fighters superior combatants on battlefields and in dungeons alike.

The fighter class gives you the following features.

## EQUIPMENT

* Leather armor
* Longbow
* 20 arrows
* Greatsword
* Backpack
* Bedroll
* Mess kit
* Tinderbox
* 10 torches
* 10 days of rations
* Waterskin

* 50 feet of hempen rope
* Shovel
* Iron pot
* Set of common clothes
* Pouch

**Second Wind.** You have a limited well of stamina you can draw on to protect yourself from harm. You can use a bonus action to regain hit points equal to 1d10 + your fighter level.

Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.

**Fighting Style: Archery.** You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons. This bonus is already included in your attacks with your longbow.

## WOOD ELF

Elves are a people of otherworldly grace, long-lived and passionate. In the earliest days of the multiverse, the first wood elves fell in love with the forests of the world, and they mystically took on characteristics of those woodland realms. Your fleetness of foot and your ability to hide in foliage or other natural phenomena are part of that mystical adaptation.

As a wood elf, you have the following traits:

**Darkvision.** You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light and in darkness in that radius as if it were dim light. You discern colors in that darkness only as shades of gray.

**Fey Ancestry.** You have advantage on saving throws you make to avoid or end the charmed condition on yourself.

**Trance.** Elves don't need to sleep, and magic can't put you to sleep. You can finish a long rest in 4 hours if you spend those hours in a trancelike meditation, during which you retain consciousness.

**Mask of the Wild.** You can take the Hide action even when you are only lightly obscured by foliage, heavy rain, falling snow, mist, or other natural phenomena.

# YOUR FOLK HERO BACKGROUND

Your parents lived in the prosperous village of Thundertree, east of the city of Neverwinter and at the edge of the Neverwinter Wood. But when nearby Mount Hotenow erupted thirty years ago, your parents fled, perhaps carrying you in your infancy (depending on how old you are). Your family drifted from village to village around the region, finding work as laborers where they could.

Your background shaped your character in important ways. You learned the languages of several different peoples (shown in "Languages" on the front of this sheet). Your skill proficiencies in Animal Handling and Survival also reflect your upbringing, working with animals and getting by in the natural world.

You've spent the last few years in Neverwinter as a carpenter working at the city's bustling docks. But it's clear to you and everyone around you that you are destined for much more. You stood up to an abusive ship captain once, so other dockworkers look up to you. Someday, you'll come into your own. You'll be a hero.

<ins>Personal Goal: Determine Your Destiny</ins>. In the remote cloister of Dragon's Rest lives an old sage who is supposed to possess great wisdom—or possibly supernatural powers. The cloister holds a temple to the dragon god Bahamut, who is a patron of heroes and a champion of justice. Maybe Elder Runara can help you determine exactly what your heroic destiny is and set you on the right path to fulfill it, so you can become the hero you know you're meant to be.

# MAKING THE CHARACTER YOURS

Follow these steps to make this character uniquely yours:

1. Choose a name and write it in the "Character Name" space on the front of this sheet. Your character's name can be anything you like, perhaps drawing from a real-world culture or a work of literature.
2. Decide what your character looks like and determine your character's gender. You decide your character's height, weight, age, and coloration (eyes, hair, and skin). You can use the page for inspiration or you can choose your own direction. You also might want to give your character a memorable physical characteristic, such as a scar, a limp, spectacles, or a tattoo. You can write notes about your character's appearance in the "Notes" space below.
3. Flesh out your character's personality, and read about your character's alignment in the rulebook (you may choose a different alignment from among the options here). The goal is to choose traits and mannerisms for your character that you'll enjoy.

# GAINING LEVELS

The DM will tell you when you reach 2nd level and then 3rd level. When you reach a new level, you gain the features below for that level.

# HIT DICE AND HIT POINTS

With each level you gain, you gain one additional Hit Die (d10), which you can use to heal yourself when you take a short rest (as illustrated in the rulebook). When you level up, add the new Hit Die to the Hit Dice box on the front sheet, and add 1d10 + 6 to your hit point maximum.

# 2ND-LEVEL FEATURE

<ins>Action Surge.</ins> You can push yourself beyond your normal limits for a moment. On your turn, you can take one additional action.

Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.

# 3RD-LEVEL FEATURE

<ins>Improved Critical.</ins> Your weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.

If you do, the target takes **1d6 + 2 slashing damage**.

## CLERIC

As a cleric, you wield magic given by a god. You revere the deity Marthammor Duin, who watches over travelers and outcasts. The cleric class gives you the following features.

**Divine Domain.** You draw magic from a divine domain—a sphere of magical influence—associated with your deity. Your domain is Life. This domain gives you features elsewhere on the character sheet.

In addition to those four, you always have these two spells prepared, thanks to your deity: *bless* and *cure wounds*.

Write your prepared spells here:

*bless*                      *cure wounds*

_______________  _______________

_______________  _______________

_______________  _______________

**Spell Slots.** You have two 1st-level spell slots you can use to cast your prepared spells. You can use either to cast different spells or to cast the same spell twice. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

You can keep track of your expended spell slots by checking them off in the Spellcasting table on this sheet's other side, where each spell slot is represented by a checkbox.

**Cantrips.** You know a few cantrips, which are spells you can cast without expending spell slots. You know the following cantrips, each of which is detailed in the rulebook:

*light*                              *thaumaturgy*
*sacred flame*

**Spell Attacks and Saving Throws.** When a creature makes a saving throw to resist one of your spells, the DC of the saving throw is **13**. When you make a spell attack, you roll **1d20 + 5** to see if you hit. These numbers are based on your spellcasting ability, which is Wisdom.

**Spell save DC = 13**

**Spell attack roll = 1d20 + 5**

# HILL DWARF

Dwarves are solid and hardy like the stone they are said to be created from, weathering the centuries with endurance. As a hill dwarf, you have the following traits.

**Darkvision.** You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light and in darkness in that radius as if it were dim light. You discern colors in that darkness only as shades of gray.

**Dwarven Resilience.** You have resistance to poison damage, and you have advantage on saving throws you make to avoid or end the poisoned condition on yourself.

**Stonecunning.** When you make an Intelligence (History) check related to the origin of stonework, you are considered proficient in the History skill and add double your proficiency bonus to the check, instead of your normal proficiency bonus (so you roll a d20 + 4 for the check).

**Dwarven Toughness.** Your hit point maximum increases by 1, and it increases by 1 every time you gain a level (included in your hit points).

**Heavy Armor.** You speed is not reduced by wearing heavy armor.

# YOUR SOLDIER BACKGROUND

You trained as a soldier on the island of Mintarn and joined a mercenary company. You traveled to the city of Neverwinter with your company to serve in both the army and city watch. Over time, you grew disillusioned with many of your fellow soldiers. They seemed to enjoy their authority at the expense of the people they're supposed to protect.

Your background shaped your character in important ways. You learned several languages in the course of your military career (shown in "Languages" above). Your skill proficiencies in Athletics and Intimidation reflect your physical training and an ability to overawe foes.

Recently you've had dreams of a shadow creeping across the sea like a shroud, swallowing an island in darkness. Though you dismissed the dreams at first, you began to hear a voice calling you to stand against death's endless hunger. Certain of your deity's wishes, you resigned your post and set out on your quest.

**Personal Goal: Banish a Shadow of Death.** Researching images from your dreams pointed you to Stormwreck Isle, not far from Neverwinter. A remote cloister there holds a temple to the dragon god Bahamut, who is a patron of heroes and a champion of justice. Someone at the cloister may hold the key to the impending doom your deity wishes you to avert.

# MAKING THE CHARACTER YOURS

Follow these steps to make this character uniquely yours:

1. Choose a name and write it in the "Character Name" space on the front of this sheet. Your character's name can be anything you like, perhaps drawing from a real-world culture or a work of literature.
2. Decide what the character looks like and determine your character's gender. You decide your character's height, weight, age, and coloration (eyes, hair, and skin). You can use the art on this page for inspiration or choose your own direction. You also might want to give your character other physical characteristics, such as a scar, a limp, spectacles, or a tattoo.
3. Flesh out your character's personality, and read about your character's alignment in the rulebook (you may choose a different alignment from among the options there). The goal is to choose traits and mannerisms for your character that you'll enjoy.

# GAINING LEVELS

The DM will tell you when you reach 2nd level and then 3rd level. When you reach a new level, you gain the features below for that level.

## HIT DICE AND HIT POINTS

With each level you gain, you gain one additional Hit Die (d8), which you can use to heal yourself when you take a short rest (explained in the rulebook). When you level up, add the new Hit Die to the Hit Dice box on this sheet, and add 1d8 + 3 to your hit point maximum (this includes the benefit of Dwarven Toughness).

## RITUAL CASTING

*Ritual Casting.* You can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared. The rulebook explains rituals.

*Disciple of Life.* Thanks to the Life Domain, your healing spells are particularly effective. Whenever you restore hit points to a creature with a spell of 1st level or higher, the creature regains additional hit points equal to 2 + the spell's level.

# SPELLCASTING ADVANCEMENT

You gain access to more spells as you gain levels. You can prepare a number of spells equal to your level + your Wisdom modifier, as shown in the Spellcasting table. You also gain more spell slots.

## SPELLCASTING

| Cleric Level | Prepared Spells | 1st-Level Slots | 2nd-Level Slots |
| ------------ | --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| 1st          | 4               | ☐☐              | —               |

| 3rd          | 6               | ☐☐☐☐            | ☐☐              |


## 2ND-LEVEL FEATURES

**Channel Divinity.** You can channel divine magic from your deity, fueling one of two effects: Turn Undead or Preserve Life. When you use Channel Divinity, choose which of these effects to create; you must then finish a short or long rest to use Channel Divinity again:

**Turn Undead.** As an action, you present your holy symbol, and each Undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly end its move in a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If it has nowhere it can move, the creature can use the Dodge action.

**Preserve Life.** As an action, you present your holy symbol and choose one or more creatures within 30 feet of yourself to heal, then distribute up to 10 hit points among them. This feature can restore a creature to no more than half of its hit point maximum.

## 3RD-LEVEL FEATURES

**Spells.** You can now prepare and cast 2nd-level spells. In addition to the spells you know at lower levels, you always have two extra spells prepared: *lesser restoration* and *spiritual weapon*.

**Preserve Life.** When you use Preserve Life, you can now distribute up to 15 hit points.
